She is a musicologist working in the music department of a university. She has a particular interest in late 16th to 18th century music, specifically that of a particular composer living and working in Rome, Wien (Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven) London and Paris. As musician and historian, Sophia needs to study the instrumentation of a musical composition of the 18th century in order to organize a music festival that compares philological and modern performances and that proposes music compositions of that time with a completely new orchestration. To do this, she needs detailed informations about musical instruments, ancient and modern: how they were used in the original compositions and in the 18th century, to which instrument family each instrument belongs, in which instruments combination they have been used in musical compositions from any era. For each instrument Sophia will have to take into account these important properties: the timbre or range of timbres; the range of pitches; the dynamic range. Sophia is also interested to know the instrument's notation."

cq17,What is the type of a specific resource?,"Recycling of a product may depend on its material composition, efficiency of recycling."
cq19,What are the components of this product?,"A manufacturer of a product needs to understand the composition and origin of the materials, as well as their production processes, to mitigate risks in the supply chain, analyse and improve the supply chain, ensure compliance with regulations etc. Although some stakeholders in the supply chain may be unknown, data origin and proof of validity is important."
cq20,Give me information about this resource.,"Resources are what is worked on in the circular value network. Resources are used as inputs but could also be outputs from the network, and its processes, steps etc. For resources that are part of a circular value network they will be of a certain type (is it a product, component or material). Also, for these resources, their composition is ideally known at some level. Resources can also be used in processing steps, but without being the main focus of the value network, e.g. consumables, catalysts."
