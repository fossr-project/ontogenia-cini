HACID,Medical diagnostics,,"A case of internal medicine reports about a patient that is found with painless jaundice, pruritus perceived as debilitating, weight loss of 15 pounds over 3 months with associated fatigue and anorexia. Additionally, the patient is affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus with difficulty controlling insulin, and hyperbilirubinemia. 

A single case can be associated with a list of solutions provided by the creator of the case. If more than one solution is provided by the creator, then one must be identified as primary and other as secondary. The case is evaluated by 5 healthcare professionals who formulated their diagnoses by taking into account the findings. Each healthcare professional provides a collection of ordered diagnoses. The ordering is based on relevance. 

Additionally, each healthcare professional is associated with personal details about specialty, seniority, country, and organisation of affiliation.",mdx-1: What are the specialties of a clinical case?,"PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/hacid/example-data/>

Polifonia,,,"This research includes looking into which organs an organ builder worked on and how their projects developed over time. This development can range from an increase of the size of the organ, to locality of their projects, or to the type or prestige of the project. The history section of the 15-part organ encyclopaedia is mostly used for this as this specifies year and changes that are made to the organs, but this obviously takes a lot of time and effort to research.",Who built and/or renovated an organ?,,
Polifonia,,,"During the project, Amy researches both artistic and technical trends surrounding organs in the Netherlands. Amy is interested in finding connections between different regions and time periods to see how the trends have developed. She also wants to put her findings in a historical and social context. Amy hopes that the knowledge graphs can help her identify initial trends. That way she knows where to dig deeper to understand the trends. In order to discover trends, comparisons similar to those needed by the organ advisor (Paul) are required. But besides the comparison of stops in organs made by the same organ builder, the comparisons can be related to almost every component of the organ. For example, the different arthistorical details on the fronts of the organs, or the wind supply system are interesting to compare.",What was the disposition of the organ at a specific point in time?,,

Paul would look up the organ in the Dutch organ encyclopaedia, which is ordered based on the year of production of the case of the organ. Because the organ is not necessarily made in the same year as the church, he first has to go through the indexes of the encyclopaedias in order to find the correct organ. Then, Paul searches for all organs that are made by the same organ builder. These organs are used as material for comparisons of the technical features. Finding and comparing the organs can be a tedious and time-consuming task. If this can be simplified and sped up by the use of the portal, Paul would save a lot of time and effort. As it turns out, the comparison of the disposition indicates that the organ up for restoration has been changed significantly during a previous restoration. This is indicated by a large difference in base stops that is used in all organs by the same organ builder. Paul now has to go visit some of the other organs and the church archives in order to verify whether some of those stops were the original stops or not.",What are the original parts of the organ?,,
