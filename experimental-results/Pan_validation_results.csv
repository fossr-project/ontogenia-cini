This suggests that while the questions may have some semantic overlap in terms of context (both related to health and disease), they are fundamentally different in their specific inquiries.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for key topics or areas of inquiry that are present in the generated CQs but not represented in the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Focus on Specific Diseases**: The generated CQs include specific inquiries about diseases (e.g., Hepatitis A) and their incidence rates, which may not be covered in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions that address specific diseases, their incidence, and demographic variations, this could be a significant gap.

- **Temporal Analysis**: The generated CQ mentions a specific time frame (2018 to 2021). If the manual list does not include questions that consider temporal changes in disease incidence or trends over time, this is another area that may be missing.

- **Demographic Variations**: The generated CQ also considers variations by age group and vaccination status. If the manual list does not include questions that explore how disease incidence varies across different demographics or vaccination statuses, this could indicate missing essential CQs.

- **Quantitative Metrics**: The generated CQ specifically asks for incidence rates per 100,000 population, which is a quantitative metric. If the manual list lacks questions that require similar quantitative analysis or metrics, this could also represent a gap.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific diseases, temporal trends, demographic variations, and quantitative metrics related to health and disease incidence. A thorough review of the manual list against these themes would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.388642281293869,0.5407884120941162,How many distinct disease categories are there?,"What is the incidence rate of Hepatitis A per 100,000 population for each age group in the Lombardy region from 2018 to 2021, and how does it vary by vaccination status?"

The BERTScore-F1 of 0.59 indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity, while the ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.22 suggests some overlap in longer sequences of words.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not addressed in the manual list.

Since the statistics indicate that there are no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 and the average cosine similarity is only 0.10, it implies that the generated CQs are likely exploring different dimensions or details that the manual CQs do not capture. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to compare the content of the generated CQs against the manual CQs directly. However, based on the provided data, we can infer that the following types of questions might be missing from the manual list:

- Questions that delve into specific details about the structure and components of the EDAM ontology, as indicated by the generated CQ regarding subsets and descriptions.
- Inquiries about the integration or interaction between different ontologies, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual CQs.
- Questions that address the functionality or modifications of algorithms and tools, as suggested by the manual CQ, but may not be fully explored in the generated set.

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list include those that focus on the specifics of ontology components, their relationships, and detailed operational aspects of the tools and algorithms used in the context of the ontologies. A thorough review of both sets would be necessary to pinpoint exact missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09953346848487854,0.5870051980018616,Are there any modification to [the algorithm] [the tool] uses?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology within the SWO ontology file?

The Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 further confirms that there are no common terms between the two questions. The BERTScore-F1 of 0.56 suggests that while the questions are not similar in terms of their wording, they may share some semantic content as evaluated by the BERT model.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the low similarity scores across the board, particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.17 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.00, it indicates that the generated CQs and the manual CQs are largely disjoint in terms of content and focus. 

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can infer the following:

- **Domain-Specific Questions**: The generated CQ about the EDAM ontology suggests a focus on ontology structure and definitions, which may not be represented in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions about ontology subsets, definitions, or relationships, these would be essential CQs that are missing.

- **Technical Functionality**: The manual CQ about XML editing indicates a focus on software functionality. If the generated CQs include questions about other functionalities, features, or technical specifications of the software that are not covered in the manual list, these would also be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Contextual Relevance**: If the generated CQs address specific use cases, applications, or scenarios relevant to the software or ontology that are not captured in the manual list, these would be essential as well.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely include:
- Questions about ontology structures, subsets, and definitions.
- Questions regarding specific functionalities or features of the software.
- Contextual or application-based questions that relate to the use of the ontology or software in practical scenarios.

To accurately identify these missing CQs, a detailed review of both the generated and manual lists would be necessary, focusing on the themes and topics that are underrepresented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1657317876815796,0.5604556798934937,Does [this software] provide XML editing?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.09 and the maximum cosine similarity of 0.09 across all pairs indicate that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or specific inquiries that the generated CQs address.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated question is deemed sufficiently similar to any manual question.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Without the actual content of the generated CQs, we can hypothesize that essential topics related to the EDAM ontology, its subsets, and their descriptions are likely missing from the manual list. Additionally, questions regarding the support of open standards in software, as indicated by the manual CQ, may not be adequately represented in the generated set.

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would include those that address specific aspects of the EDAM ontology, its structure, and its relationship with other ontologies, as well as questions that explore the implications of software compliance with open standards. A detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific missing questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.09442205727100372,0.5685678124427795,To what extent does [the software] support appropriate open standards?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The only pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is [this software] compatible with [it]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.14**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common elements between the two questions when considering their token sets. The BERTScore-F1 for this pair is **0.51**, which suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity despite the low cosine and Jaccard scores.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board (average cosine similarity of **0.14**, average Jaccard similarity of **0.00**, and no matches with cosine similarity ≥ **0.6**), it suggests that the generated CQs are significantly different from those in the manual list.

Since the statistics indicate that there are no pairs with a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher, it implies that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not addressed in the manual list. 

To identify the essential CQs that are missing, one would typically need to:

- Review the content of the generated CQs to identify themes, topics, or specific inquiries that are not represented in the manual CQs.
- Compare the generated CQs against the manual list to highlight any unique questions or areas of inquiry that are present in the generated set but absent in the manual set.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of missing essential CQs. A detailed comparison of the two sets would be necessary to identify specific gaps in the manual list. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that the generated CQs are likely exploring different dimensions of the subject matter, and a thorough review of both sets is required to pinpoint the essential questions that are missing from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.14402484893798828,0.5115268230438232,Is [this software] compatible with [it]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What open source, maintained software can I use to process [these] in [this format]?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.15
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

This pair represents the only instance of similarity recorded, as both the maximum and average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.15, indicating that this is the only pair that reached that level of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and content of both the generated and manual CQs. However, based on the provided statistics, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The overall low similarity scores (average cosine similarity of 0.15, average Jaccard similarity of 0.07, and average BLEU of 0.01) suggest that the generated CQs and the manual CQs are quite different in terms of wording and possibly in the concepts they address. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or questions that the generated CQs cover.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This further emphasizes that the manual list may be missing critical questions that are relevant to the domain or context of the generated CQs.

- **Content Analysis**: Without the actual content of the generated CQs, it is difficult to specify which essential CQs are missing. However, one could hypothesize that if the generated CQs are focused on specific ontologies (like EDAM and SWO), the manual list may lack questions that explore the relationships, definitions, or applications of these ontologies in detail.

In summary, while we cannot pinpoint specific missing CQs without additional context, the analysis suggests that the manual list may not adequately cover the breadth of topics represented in the generated CQs, particularly those related to ontology definitions, applications, and processing tools. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific gaps.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.14755669236183167,0.5524824857711792,"What open source, maintained software can I use to process [these] in [this format]?",What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is the output format of [it] proprietary?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.08
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05
- **BERTScore-F1**: 0.53
- **BLEU**: 0.01
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.08

This pair represents the highest similarity across all metrics, but it is important to note that the values are relatively low, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or phrasing.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for generated CQs that do not have a corresponding match in the manual list, especially those that cover key concepts or areas of inquiry relevant to the domain of interest. 

Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity (0.08) and Jaccard similarity (0.05) suggest that there is a significant divergence between the generated and manual CQs. This indicates that many generated CQs may not have been captured in the manual list.
  
- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of 0.00 indicates that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, suggesting that the manual list may be missing several essential questions that are relevant to the domain.

- **Content Coverage**: The generated CQ about the ""subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology"" suggests a focus on ontology structure and relationships, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions addressing ontology specifics, relationships, or detailed descriptions, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

In summary, while specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the actual content of the manual list, it is clear that the generated CQs likely cover important aspects of the domain that are not reflected in the manual list, particularly regarding ontology details and relationships. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to pinpoint specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.08453801274299622,0.5336337685585022,Is the output format of [it] proprietary?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO ontology?

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Can I render [it] if the software supplier goes out of business?""

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are reported as 0.04, which is the maximum value observed across all pairs. This indicates that, despite being the highest, the similarity is still very low, suggesting that the content and context of these questions are quite different.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, based on the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and other metrics are all very low (around 0.04), indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or questions that the generated CQs address.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is reported as 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Without specific examples of the generated CQs, we can hypothesize that essential topics related to the EDAM ontology, its subsets, and their descriptions are likely missing from the manual list. If the generated CQs focus on specific aspects of ontology representation, software supplier issues, or other domain-specific inquiries, these may not be reflected in the manual list.

In conclusion, the manual list appears to be missing essential CQs that cover the specific details and inquiries related to the EDAM ontology and its application, as indicated by the generated CQs. A thorough review of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific questions that are absent from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.037976011633872986,0.541796088218689,Can I render [it] if the software supplier goes out of business?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO ontology file?

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.19** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.09**. These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, suggesting that the content and focus of the questions differ significantly. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also **0.19**, indicating that this is the only pair that reached this level of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for their content, themes, and topics that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your question, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Thematic Analysis**: Review the generated CQs for themes or topics that are not covered in the manual CQs. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about specific functionalities, data relationships, or ontology-specific queries that are not present in the manual list, these would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Domain Coverage**: Check if the generated CQs address different aspects of the domain that the manual CQs do not. For example, if the generated CQs explore new data types, relationships, or use cases relevant to the ontologies in question, these should be noted as missing.

- **User Needs**: Consider the potential user needs that may not be addressed by the manual CQs. If the generated CQs reflect common queries or concerns that users might have when interacting with the ontologies, these should be highlighted as essential missing questions.

In summary, without the specific content of the generated CQs, it is not possible to list the exact missing essential CQs. However, the analysis should focus on thematic coverage, domain relevance, and user needs to identify any gaps in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.19433696568012238,0.5856045484542847,"Given [input x], what are the data exports for [this version] of [x]?",What are the subsets and their descriptions defined within the SWO and EDAM ontologies?

The BLEU score is **0.00**, indicating no overlap in n-grams, and the ROUGE-L F1 score is **0.08**, which is also quite low.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.12**, which is quite low, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of semantic content.
- The average Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, suggesting that there are no shared terms or phrases between the generated and manual lists.
- The precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual CQs.

Given these statistics, it can be inferred that the manual list is likely missing a significant number of essential CQs that are present in the generated list. The lack of high similarity scores suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to compare their content and intent against the manual list. However, based on the provided data, it is clear that there is a substantial gap in coverage, and many essential CQs from the generated set are not reflected in the manual set. 

In summary, the manual list appears to lack essential CQs that address the topics or questions represented in the generated set, as evidenced by the low similarity scores across various metrics.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.12204085290431976,0.5591381192207336,Where can I get [the software]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO ontology file?

The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, which further suggests that there is no overlap in the terms used in the two questions. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest cosine similarity being only 0.19), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not addressed in the manual list.

Since the statistics indicate that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it implies that none of the generated CQs closely align with the manual CQs. Therefore, it is likely that the generated CQs include essential questions that are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to review the content of the generated CQs and compare them against the manual CQs. However, since the statistics do not provide a detailed list of the generated CQs, we can infer that the generated set likely contains questions that explore different facets of the ontology or related topics that are not captured in the manual set.

In summary, the essential CQs that are missing from the manual list are those that are present in the generated set but do not have a corresponding match in the manual set, particularly those that address different aspects of the ontology or related queries.

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.10** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.00**. The cosine similarity score of 0.10 is the maximum observed across all pairs, and it indicates a very low level of similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity of 0.00 further confirms that there are no common elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.10**, and the maximum is also **0.10**, indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not represented in the manual list.

- **Precision and Matches**: The Precision@0.6 score is **0.00**, meaning that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher. This indicates that the generated CQs are likely addressing different questions or concepts that are not captured in the manual list.

Given these observations, it can be inferred that the manual list may be missing essential CQs that are relevant to the domain of the generated CQs. Specifically, the generated CQ about the EDAM ontology suggests a focus on ontology structure and definitions, which may not be represented in the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to analyze the content and context of the generated CQs more thoroughly. However, based on the provided data, it is clear that there is a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs, indicating that essential questions related to ontology definitions, subsets, and their descriptions are likely missing from the manual list. 

In summary, the manual list may lack CQs that address:
- Ontology structures and definitions
- Specific subsets within the EDAM ontology
- Relationships between different ontologies (e.g., SWO and EDAM)

These topics are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the domain and should be included in the manual list to ensure completeness.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.10343175381422043,0.5043736696243286,How do I get help with [it]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology file?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets defined within the SWO and EDAM ontology, and who are the creators associated with these ontologies?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""How can I get problems with [it] fixed?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.02
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

These values indicate that the two questions are very dissimilar, as the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.02, which is quite low. This suggests that the generated and manual CQs do not share significant semantic content or structure.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs. Given that the generated CQ focuses on specific ontologies (SWO and EDAM) and their subsets, as well as the creators associated with these ontologies, it suggests a need for questions that address:

- **Ontology Structure**: Questions that inquire about the hierarchical or structural relationships within the ontologies.
- **Ontology Creators**: Questions that ask about the authors or contributors to the ontologies, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
- **Use Cases or Applications**: Questions that explore how these ontologies can be applied in real-world scenarios or specific problems they aim to solve.

Since the statistics indicate a lack of high similarity and the precision metrics show no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it is likely that the manual list does not adequately cover the specific inquiries related to ontology subsets and their creators. 

In summary, essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list could include:
- ""What are the main categories or classes defined in the SWO ontology?""
- ""Who are the primary contributors to the EDAM ontology?""
- ""How can the SWO and EDAM ontologies be utilized in biomedical research?""

This pair represents the highest similarity across all metrics, although the cosine similarity is relatively low (0.14), indicating that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity is 0.00, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. The BERTScore-F1 of 0.56 indicates some level of semantic similarity, but it is still not very high.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to compare the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify any that are present in the generated set but absent in the manual set. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of either the generated or manual CQs, we can only infer based on the similarity metrics.

Given the low average cosine similarity (0.14) and the fact that no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 were found, it suggests that the generated CQs may not closely align with the manual CQs. This could imply that there are potentially many essential CQs that are present in the generated set but not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to:
- Review the complete list of generated CQs.
- Compare them against the complete list of manual CQs.
- Identify any generated CQs that do not have a corresponding manual CQ, especially those that address key aspects of the domain or context that may not be covered by the manual list.

In summary, without the complete lists of CQs, we cannot definitively state which essential CQs are missing, but the low similarity scores indicate that there are likely significant gaps between the two sets. A detailed comparison of the full lists would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1413763165473938,0.5633715391159058,Where do I get updates for [this software]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO merged ontology file?

The only pair that has been identified with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology, and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Who developed [it]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.25
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while there is some degree of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions (as indicated by the cosine similarity), the overlap in terms of shared terms or tokens is nonexistent (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity). The low cosine similarity suggests that the generated question is not closely aligned with the manual question in terms of semantic content, despite the shared theme of development or creation.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.25) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover a broader or different range of topics than those present in the manual list. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Specificity in Ontology Details**: The generated CQ about ""different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology"" indicates a focus on specific details about ontology structures that may not be captured in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions that probe into the specifics of ontology definitions, this could be a significant gap.
  
- **Creator Information**: The generated CQ also asks about ""creators associated with the SWO ontology,"" which suggests a focus on authorship or development history. If the manual list does not include questions about who developed or contributed to specific ontologies, this is another area where essential CQs may be missing.

- **Comparative Questions**: The generated CQ combines inquiries about two different ontologies (EDAM and SWO). If the manual list does not include comparative questions that ask about relationships or differences between multiple ontologies, this could represent a missing dimension in the manual CQs.

- **Functional or Application-Based Questions**: If the generated CQs include questions about the applications or uses of the ontologies (e.g., ""How is the EDAM ontology applied in bioinformatics?""), and these are absent from the manual list, this could indicate a lack of practical application-focused questions.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that delve into specific ontology details, creator information, comparative aspects, and practical applications, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.2533975839614868,0.5473054647445679,Who developed [it]?,"What are the different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology, and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?"

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology within the SWO ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the homepage of [the software]?""

This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.23
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.11

These scores indicate that while there is some level of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.23, which suggests that this is the most similar pair in the entire dataset.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity is low (0.23) and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not represented in the manual list.

Since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer that the generated CQs likely include more detailed or specific inquiries related to the EDAM ontology and its subsets, which may not be captured in the manual list. 

To identify the essential CQs that are missing, one would typically:
- Review the generated CQs to identify unique topics or questions that are not addressed in the manual list.
- Look for areas of inquiry related to ontology structure, relationships, or specific functionalities that may be relevant to the domain but are absent from the manual CQs.

In summary, without the actual content of the manual list, we cannot pinpoint specific missing CQs, but it is clear that the generated CQs likely encompass a broader range of topics related to the EDAM ontology that are not reflected in the manual list.

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are reported as -0.00 and 0.00, respectively. This indicates that there is virtually no similarity between the two questions, as both metrics suggest a lack of overlap in terms of content or structure. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average BERTScore-F1 of 0.56 suggests that while there is some semantic similarity between the generated and manual CQs, it is not reflected in the traditional similarity metrics (cosine, Jaccard, BLEU, ROUGE-L), which are all at 0. This discrepancy indicates that the generated CQs may contain relevant content that is not captured in the manual list.

Given that the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00 and there are no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it implies that the manual list lacks CQs that are semantically similar or relevant to the generated CQs. 

To identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, one would typically need to review the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the statistics, it can be inferred that:

- The manual list may be missing CQs that address specific aspects of the EDAM ontology, such as its subsets and descriptions, as highlighted in the generated CQ.
- Additionally, the manual list may lack questions that explore collaboration with developers or other stakeholders, as indicated by the generated CQs.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific inquiries about the EDAM ontology and its integration with other ontologies, as well as questions about collaboration opportunities in software development contexts.

The Jaccard similarity is also 0.00, suggesting that there are no common elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is very low (0.09), indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The average Jaccard similarity is 0.00, which suggests that there are no overlapping terms or concepts between the generated and manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing several essential CQs that could cover a broader range of topics or concepts relevant to the domain of interest. The generated CQs, while not closely aligned with the manual ones, may include important questions that address specific aspects of the ontology or related concepts that are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to see if they address key areas such as:

- Definitions and relationships within the ontology.
- Use cases or applications of the ontology.
- Specific queries about the data or entities represented in the ontology.
- Contextual or domain-specific questions that are relevant to users or stakeholders.

In summary, the manual list appears to lack essential CQs that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ontology and its applications, as indicated by the low similarity scores and the absence of high-precision matches.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, based on the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.13 and the maximum of 0.13 indicate that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or questions that the generated CQs address.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list.

- **Content Analysis**: Without specific content from the generated CQs, we cannot definitively list the essential CQs that are missing. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the manual list may not cover certain aspects of the EDAM ontology or related topics that the generated CQs are addressing, such as specific subsets, their descriptions, or other ontology-related queries.

In summary, while we cannot pinpoint exact missing CQs without further content analysis, the low similarity scores and precision metrics suggest that the manual list is likely missing essential questions related to the ontology and its subsets, which are present in the generated CQs.

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.12 suggests that the vectors representing these questions are not closely aligned in the semantic space, and the Jaccard similarity of 0.05 indicates that there is minimal overlap in the terms used in both questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- The generated CQ regarding the ""different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology"" indicates a focus on ontology structure and definitions, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This suggests that there may be a lack of questions related to ontology specifics, such as:
  - ""What are the key components of the EDAM ontology?""
  - ""How are the subsets of the EDAM ontology categorized?""

- The manual CQ about compliance with the ""ISO-4 standard"" suggests a focus on standards and compliance, which may not be sufficiently covered in the generated CQs. This indicates a potential gap in questions related to standards, such as:
  - ""What standards does the software comply with?""
  - ""How does the software ensure compliance with industry standards?""

Overall, the analysis indicates that the generated CQs may be exploring different dimensions of the subject matter, particularly in ontology structure and definitions, while the manual CQs may focus more on compliance and standards. This discrepancy highlights the need for a more comprehensive set of CQs that encompasses both aspects to ensure thorough coverage of the domain.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.11679723113775253,0.5911474227905273,Does [this software] meet the ISO-4 standard?,What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology file?

This pair exhibits the highest similarity across all metrics, but it is important to note that the values are quite low overall, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and intent of the generated CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not represented in the manual list. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Ontology Specificity**: The generated CQ about the ""different subsets of EDAM ontology"" indicates a focus on ontology structure and classification, which may not be addressed in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions about specific ontologies or their components, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Data Processing Context**: The generated CQ implies a need for understanding how different subsets of the ontology relate to data processing or software usage. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the relationship between ontology subsets and practical applications, this could be another missing area.

3. **Descriptive Aspects**: The mention of ""descriptions"" in the generated CQ suggests a need for detailed explanations or definitions of the ontology subsets. If the manual list lacks questions that seek descriptive information about concepts or terms, this could be an essential omission.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: If the generated CQs include questions that compare different ontologies or subsets, and the manual list does not, this could indicate a missing perspective that is crucial for comprehensive understanding.

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals that while the highest similarity pair exists, the overall low similarity scores suggest a significant divergence between the generated and manual CQs. Essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific ontology details, practical applications, descriptive inquiries, and comparative analyses. Addressing these gaps could enhance the completeness and relevance of the manual list of competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.11371496319770813,0.5565407276153564,Do I know anyone who has used [this software] or processed [this type of data]?,What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology and their descriptions?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and objectives of the CQs. However, based on the low similarity scores (average cosine similarity of 0.17 and average Jaccard similarity of 0.13), it can be inferred that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

Given the nature of the generated CQ, which focuses on the specifics of the EDAM ontology and its subsets, it suggests that the manual list may be lacking in questions that:

- Inquire about the structure and components of specific ontologies (like EDAM).
- Explore the relationships between different ontologies (e.g., how EDAM relates to SWO).
- Address the definitions and descriptions of terms within the ontology.
- Ask about the application or use cases of the ontology in practical scenarios.

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint which topics or questions are not adequately covered in the manual list. Given the low precision (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it is likely that many relevant questions regarding ontology specifics, their applications, and interrelations are missing from the manual list.

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.08, which suggests that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The average Jaccard similarity is 0.00, indicating that there are no shared elements between the generated and manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs.

Given these statistics, it can be inferred that the generated CQs are significantly different from the manual CQs, and therefore, many essential CQs may be missing from the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the objectives and requirements of the domain represented by the manual CQs. However, since the statistics indicate a lack of similarity, it is likely that the manual list does not cover key areas or questions that the generated CQs address.

In summary, without specific content from the manual list, it is difficult to pinpoint exact missing CQs, but the analysis suggests that there are likely several essential questions related to the domain that are not represented in the manual list, given the low similarity scores. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the context and objectives of the manual CQs would be necessary to identify these missing questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.07821659743785858,0.5093717575073242,How actively developed is [it]?,What are the different subsets and their descriptions available in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology file?

This suggests that the content and context of the questions are largely different, despite being the highest similarity pair in this analysis.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average similarity scores across various metrics (cosine, Jaccard, BLEU, ROUGE-L), it can be inferred that the generated CQs may cover a broader or different range of topics compared to the manual CQs. 

To identify essential CQs that might be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following:

- **Domain-Specific Questions**: The generated CQs may include specific inquiries about the EDAM ontology and its subsets, which are not represented in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions that delve into ontology structures, relationships, or specific attributes, these would be essential CQs that are missing.

- **Technical Aspects**: Questions that address technical aspects of software quality, ontology integration, or data representation might be absent. For instance, questions about how the EDAM ontology interacts with other ontologies or how it is applied in practical scenarios could be crucial.

- **Comparative Analysis**: If the generated CQs include comparative questions (e.g., comparing different ontologies or methodologies), and these are not present in the manual list, they would represent a gap.

- **User-Centric Queries**: Questions that focus on user experiences, usability, or practical applications of the software in question may also be missing. These types of questions are often essential for understanding the impact of software quality on end-users.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific inquiries about ontology structures, technical aspects of software quality, comparative analyses, and user-centric queries. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific questions that fill these gaps.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.07033616304397583,0.5914381742477417,What do others say about [the software] quality?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology within the SWO ontology file?

Given that the generated CQs are not closely matching the manual CQs, it is likely that several essential questions that could be relevant to the domain or topic of interest are missing from the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to analyze the content and context of the generated CQs more closely. However, based on the low similarity scores, it can be inferred that the manual list may lack questions that cover:

- Specific aspects of the EDAM ontology, such as its subsets and their descriptions.
- Detailed comparisons or differences between versions of the ontology or related files.
- Questions that explore the implications or applications of the ontology in practical scenarios.

In summary, the manual list appears to be missing essential CQs that address the nuances and specific details of the ontology, as indicated by the low similarity scores and the lack of high-precision matches. Further analysis of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint exact questions that should be included in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.25731921195983887,0.6008395552635193,What are the differences between versions of [it]?,What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs and compare them to the manual CQs. 

Given the statistics provided, the generated CQs focus on specific aspects of the EDAM ontology and the SWO ontology, such as:

- The different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology.
- The creators associated with the SWO ontology.

The manual list, on the other hand, contains questions that are more general and do not address the specific details of the ontologies mentioned in the generated CQs. The manual questions seem to focus on broader topics like open-source development and community involvement, which do not directly relate to the specifics of the ontologies.

**Missing Essential CQs:**
1. Questions that inquire about the specific subsets or categories within the EDAM ontology.
2. Questions that ask about the creators or contributors to the SWO ontology.
3. Questions that explore the relationships or connections between the EDAM and SWO ontologies.

In summary, the manual list lacks detailed questions that delve into the specifics of the ontologies, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The generated CQs highlight these aspects, indicating that the manual list could benefit from incorporating more focused and detailed questions related to the ontologies in question.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.06509613990783691,0.5153619050979614,Is [this software] open source development?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as specified in the SWO merged ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What license does [it] have, and what is its permissiveness?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.15
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.08

These values represent the highest similarity scores across all pairs analyzed, indicating that while the two questions are not closely related, they are the most similar among the set.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and intent of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest being 0.15), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not addressed in the manual list.

While the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions might be essential and potentially missing based on common practices in ontology and knowledge representation:

1. **Questions about Relationships**: CQs that inquire about the relationships between different entities or classes within the ontology. For example, ""How do the different subsets of the EDAM ontology relate to each other?""

2. **Questions about Use Cases**: CQs that explore practical applications or use cases of the ontology. For example, ""In what scenarios can the EDAM ontology be applied effectively?""

3. **Questions about Updates and Versions**: CQs that ask about the versioning or updates of the ontology. For example, ""What are the latest updates to the EDAM ontology, and how do they impact its use?""

4. **Questions about Integration**: CQs that focus on how the EDAM ontology integrates with other ontologies or systems. For example, ""How does the EDAM ontology integrate with the SWO ontology?""

5. **Questions about Data Quality**: CQs that address the quality or reliability of the data represented in the ontology. For example, ""What measures are in place to ensure the quality of data in the EDAM ontology?""

6. **Questions about User Guidance**: CQs that provide guidance for users on how to navigate or utilize the ontology. For example, ""What resources are available for users to understand and utilize the EDAM ontology?""

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would focus on relationships, use cases, updates, integration, data quality, and user guidance related to the ontology. These areas are critical for a comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of the ontology, and their absence could limit the utility of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.14578744769096375,0.5451796650886536,"What license does [it] have, and what is its permissiveness?",What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as specified in the SWO merged ontology file?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is [it] open source or not?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.10**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. However, it is important to note that this value is quite low, indicating that the two questions are not closely related in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for questions that are relevant to the domain or context of the ontology being discussed but are not represented in the manual list. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific inquiries that are not captured in the manual list.

However, without access to the actual content of the manual list of CQs, I can only provide a general approach to identifying missing essential CQs:

- **Domain Coverage**: Review the generated CQs to identify topics or areas that are not addressed in the manual list. For example, if the generated CQs include questions about specific functionalities, relationships, or applications of the ontology that are not present in the manual list, these would be considered missing.

- **Specificity and Detail**: Check if the generated CQs provide more detailed inquiries about the ontology, such as specific subsets, properties, or use cases that are not mentioned in the manual list.

- **User Needs**: Consider the potential needs of users who would interact with the ontology. If the generated CQs address user scenarios or practical applications that the manual list does not, these should be highlighted as missing.

In summary, to accurately identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a comparative analysis of the content of both sets of CQs is necessary. The low similarity scores suggest that there may be significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled by the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09851200878620148,0.5119175314903259,Is [it] open source or not?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as specified in the SWO ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""At what point did the license type of [it] change?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.10
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

These values indicate that while there is some level of similarity, it is relatively low across the board. The maximum cosine similarity for all pairs is also 0.10, which suggests that this is the only pair that reached this level of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to compare the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify any significant questions that are present in the generated set but absent in the manual set. However, the provided statistics do not include a comprehensive list of either the generated or manual CQs, making it difficult to identify specific missing questions.

Given the low similarity scores (particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.10 and average Jaccard similarity of 0.04), it can be inferred that there may be several essential CQs in the generated set that do not have corresponding questions in the manual set. The lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 (with a precision of 0.00) further suggests that the two sets are quite distinct from one another.

To accurately identify the missing essential CQs, a detailed comparison of the content of both sets would be necessary. This would involve analyzing the themes, topics, and specific inquiries present in the generated CQs that are not reflected in the manual CQs. Without that detailed comparison, we cannot definitively list the missing essential CQs. 

In summary, while we can identify the pair with the highest similarity, the identification of missing essential CQs requires further analysis of the actual content of both sets of questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09554611146450043,0.5658490657806396,At what point did the license type of [it] change?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as specified in the SWO ontology file?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with its development?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Who owns the copyright for [it]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.22** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.05**. The cosine similarity score indicates a low level of semantic similarity between the two questions, suggesting that while they may share some thematic elements, they are fundamentally different in their focus and intent. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is also quite low.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Here are some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing:

- **Ontology Structure and Relationships**: The generated CQ about ""different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology"" indicates a focus on the structural aspects of the ontology, which may not be covered in the manual list. Questions about how these subsets relate to each other or their hierarchical organization could be essential.

- **Creators and Contributors**: The mention of ""creators associated with its development"" in the generated CQ suggests a focus on the authorship and contributions to the ontology. If the manual list does not include questions about who developed or contributed to the ontology, this is a significant gap.

- **Usage and Application**: Questions regarding how the EDAM ontology is applied in practice, or its relevance to specific domains, may also be missing. This could include inquiries about case studies or examples of its implementation.

- **Updates and Versions**: If there are questions regarding the evolution of the ontology, such as how it has been updated over time or what versions exist, these may also be absent from the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list include those that explore the ontology's structure, authorship, practical applications, and historical development. The low similarity scores suggest that the generated CQs are addressing different facets of the topic that may not be fully captured in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.2187047004699707,0.6092876195907593,Who owns the copyright for [it]?,What are the different subsets defined within the EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with its development?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the licensing history of [it]?""

This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.25
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.16
- **BERTScore-F1**: 0.59
- **BLEU**: 0.01
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.24

These scores indicate that while the cosine and Jaccard similarities are relatively low, the BERTScore-F1 is notably higher, suggesting that the semantic content of the questions may be somewhat aligned despite their different phrasing. However, the overall similarity metrics indicate that the generated and manual questions are not closely related.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the maximum cosine similarity between any generated and manual CQ is 0.25, it suggests that there is a significant gap in the content and focus of the questions.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Ontology Specificity**: The generated CQs focus on specific ontologies (e.g., EDAM and SWO) and their subsets or creators. If the manual list does not include questions about specific ontologies, their relationships, or their creators, these could be considered essential missing CQs.
- **Licensing and Usage**: The generated CQ about licensing history indicates a focus on the legal and usage aspects of ontologies. If the manual list lacks questions addressing licensing, usage rights, or historical context of ontologies, these would also be essential missing CQs.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare different ontologies or explore their interoperability may also be missing. For example, questions like ""How do the EDAM and SWO ontologies differ in their structure and application?"" could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely revolve around specific ontology details, licensing and usage questions, and comparative analyses of different ontologies. The low similarity scores suggest that the manual list may not adequately cover the breadth of topics represented in the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.2499798834323883,0.5888999700546265,What is the licensing history of [it]?,What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not addressed in the manual list.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, we can only infer that the generated CQs likely include questions that explore different facets of the subject matter, such as:

- Specific definitions or descriptions of concepts within the EDAM ontology.
- Relationships between different entities or concepts in the ontology.
- Queries about the application or implications of the ontology in practical scenarios.

Since the average cosine similarity and other similarity metrics are very low, it is reasonable to conclude that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of these specific areas, which are represented in the generated CQs. 

To identify the exact missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the content of both sets would be necessary. This would involve examining the themes, topics, and specific terminology used in the generated CQs that do not appear in the manual list.

- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.02
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

Despite being the highest similarity pair, the values are notably low across all metrics, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are largely dissimilar. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.02, which suggests that no other pairs exceed this level of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low similarity scores, it appears that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. 

Since the average cosine similarity is 0.02 and the maximum is also 0.02, it indicates that the generated CQs are not capturing the essence of the manual CQs effectively. The absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 further suggests that there are significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or questions that the generated CQs are addressing.

To identify specific essential CQs that may be missing, one would typically need to review the content of both sets of CQs in detail. However, based on the provided data, it can be inferred that the manual list may lack coverage on the following potential areas:

- **Ontology-specific inquiries**: Questions related to the structure, subsets, and creators of specific ontologies (e.g., EDAM and SWO) are present in the generated CQs but not reflected in the manual list.
- **Technical or domain-specific questions**: The generated CQs may include technical aspects or domain-specific inquiries that are not represented in the manual list, which could be more general or focused on different themes.

In summary, the manual list likely lacks detailed questions about ontology structures, creators, and possibly other technical aspects that are present in the generated CQs.

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: -0.02
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

Despite being labeled as the ""highest similarity,"" it is important to note that the cosine similarity is negative, which suggests that the two questions are not similar in meaning or context. The Jaccard similarity being 0 further indicates that there are no common elements between the two questions. This highlights a significant disconnect between the generated and manual CQs.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of the generated CQs or the manual CQs, we can infer the following based on the low similarity scores:

- **Lack of Thematic Overlap**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific ontologies (SWO and EDAM) and their creators, which suggests a focus on ontology management and metadata. If the manual CQs do not address similar themes, then essential questions related to ontology definitions, relationships, and creators may be missing.

- **Contextual Relevance**: If the manual CQs do not include questions about the structure, relationships, or applications of the ontologies in question, then these could be considered essential missing CQs. For example, questions like ""What is the purpose of the SWO ontology?"" or ""How do the SWO and EDAM ontologies interact?"" could be essential but are not represented in the manual list.

- **Technical and Practical Queries**: Questions that address practical usage, such as ""How can I access the SWO ontology?"" or ""What tools are available for working with EDAM?"" may also be missing if the manual list is primarily theoretical or abstract.

In summary, without the specific content of the manual CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint exact missing questions. However, it is clear that there is a significant gap in thematic and contextual alignment between the generated and manual CQs, indicating that essential questions related to ontology management, usage, and relationships are likely absent from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",-0.024317800998687744,0.5206761956214905,Do I need a password to use [it]?,"What are the subsets defined within the SWO and EDAM ontologies, and who are the creators associated with these ontologies?"

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low similarity scores, it appears that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. 

The following points can be inferred:

- **Lack of Overlap**: The average cosine similarity of **0.10** and the average Jaccard similarity of **0.00** indicate that the generated CQs are not closely related to the manual CQs. This suggests that the manual list may be missing a variety of questions that cover different aspects of the domain or topic being addressed.
  
- **Potential Missing CQs**: Since the generated CQs seem to explore specific aspects of the EDAM ontology and its relationship with the SWO ontology, it is likely that the manual list lacks questions that delve into:
  - The relationships between different ontologies.
  - Specific attributes or properties of the entities within the ontologies.
  - The creators or contributors to the ontologies.
  - Use cases or applications of the ontologies in real-world scenarios.

Given the context of the generated CQ, essential CQs that might be missing could include:
- ""What are the key features of the EDAM ontology?""
- ""How does the SWO ontology utilize the EDAM ontology?""
- ""Who are the main contributors to the development of the SWO ontology?""
- ""What are the applications of the SWO ontology in biomedical research?""

In summary, the manual list appears to be lacking in depth and variety, particularly in relation to the specific ontological aspects and relationships that the generated CQs address. This indicates a need for a more comprehensive set of CQs in the manual to ensure that all relevant areas are covered.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09990744292736053,0.5155377984046936,Is [it] free or not?,"What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology included in the SWO ontology, and who are the creators associated with it?"

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What level of expertise is required to use [it]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.15** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. These values represent the highest similarity scores among all pairs analyzed, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low overall.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for CQs that are relevant to the domain or context but are not represented in the manual set. Given the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest being 0.15), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list.

However, without access to the complete list of generated CQs and the manual CQs, I can only provide a general approach to identifying missing essential CQs:

- **Domain Coverage**: Review the generated CQs to identify topics or areas that are not addressed in the manual CQs. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about specific functionalities, use cases, or user interactions with the ontology that are not present in the manual list, these would be considered missing.

- **Depth and Breadth**: Analyze whether the manual CQs cover the necessary depth and breadth of the subject matter. If the generated CQs delve into specific details or scenarios that the manual CQs do not, those would be essential questions that are missing.

- **Stakeholder Needs**: Consider the needs of the stakeholders or users who would be utilizing the ontology. If the generated CQs reflect user concerns or requirements that are not addressed in the manual list, these should be highlighted as missing.

In summary, to accurately identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a detailed comparison of the content and focus of both sets of CQs is necessary. The low similarity scores suggest that there may be significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled by the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.15015165507793427,0.5548610687255859,What level of expertise is required to use [it]?,What are the different subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO merged ontology file?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Are there any usage examples for [it]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.12**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common terms between the two questions.

The BLEU score is **0.00**, indicating no n-gram overlap, and the ROUGE-L F1 score is **0.08**, which also reflects minimal overlap in terms of the longest common subsequence.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of both the generated and manual CQs. However, based on the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.12** and the average Jaccard similarity of **0.00** suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or specific queries that the generated CQs address.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **0.00**, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated questions are deemed sufficiently similar to any manual questions.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Given the nature of the generated CQ, which references specific ontologies (EDAM and SWO), it is likely that essential CQs related to ontology usage, relationships between different ontologies, or specific examples of ontology applications are missing from the manual list. 

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that explore:
- Specific relationships or hierarchies within the EDAM ontology.
- Practical applications or case studies involving the EDAM and SWO ontologies.
- Detailed inquiries about the definitions and roles of subsets within the ontologies.

To accurately identify the missing CQs, a more detailed comparison of the content and themes of both sets of questions would be necessary.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.11707984656095505,0.5709818005561829,Are there any usage examples for [it]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology file?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with each subset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is there any documentation for [it] and where can I find it?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.19** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity indicates a very low level of semantic similarity between the two questions, suggesting that they are not closely related in terms of content or intent. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is also quite low, reinforcing the idea that these questions do not share significant common ground.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not addressed in the manual list. 

Here are some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing:

- **Specificity of Ontology Elements**: The generated CQ about the ""different subsets of EDAM ontology"" indicates a need for questions that delve into the structure and components of the ontology, which may not be present in the manual list.
  
- **Creators and Contributors**: The mention of ""creators associated with each subset"" suggests that there may be a lack of questions regarding the authorship or contributions to the ontology, which could be an important aspect for users seeking to understand the provenance of the ontology.

- **Documentation and Resources**: While the manual CQ touches on documentation, it may not comprehensively cover the types of documentation available, such as user guides, technical specifications, or tutorials that could be essential for users.

- **Use Cases and Applications**: Generated CQs might include questions about practical applications or use cases of the EDAM ontology, which could be missing from the manual list.

- **Updates and Versioning**: Questions regarding how the ontology is updated or how versioning is managed could also be essential but may not be represented in the manual list.

In summary, the generated CQs likely highlight specific aspects of the EDAM ontology that are not fully captured in the manual list, particularly regarding its structure, authorship, documentation, applications, and maintenance. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify all missing essential questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.19362859427928925,0.579919695854187,Is there any documentation for [it] and where can I find it?,What are the different subsets of EDAM ontology and who are the creators associated with each subset?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO merged ontology file?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Does [it] have a tutorial?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.19**, which is the maximum score recorded for all pairs. However, it is important to note that while this is the highest similarity score, it is still relatively low, indicating that the generated and manual questions are not closely aligned in terms of content or intent.

Other similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00
- **BERTScore-F1**: 0.54
- **BLEU**: 0.00
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.00

The low Jaccard, BLEU, and ROUGE-L scores suggest that there is little to no overlap in the actual words or phrases used in the two questions, further emphasizing the limited similarity despite the higher BERTScore-F1.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for generated CQs that do not have a corresponding manual CQ with a high similarity score. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.19**, and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of **0.6 or higher**. This indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs, suggesting that many potentially relevant questions may be missing from the manual list.
  
- The absence of any matches with a cosine similarity of **0.6 or higher** implies that the manual list may not cover the breadth of topics or questions that the generated CQs address. 

- Since the maximum Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, it indicates that there are no shared terms between the generated and manual questions, which further suggests that the manual list may lack essential questions that are relevant to the domain or context of the generated CQs.

In conclusion, without specific examples of the generated CQs beyond the one provided, it is difficult to pinpoint exact missing questions. However, it is clear that the manual list is lacking in coverage, and a review of the generated CQs should be conducted to identify essential questions that are not represented in the manual list. This could involve analyzing the topics, themes, or specific inquiries posed in the generated CQs that are not addressed in the manual set.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1883309781551361,0.5414717793464661,Does [it] have a tutorial?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as represented in the SWO merged ontology file?

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.27** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.05**. The cosine similarity score of 0.27 is the maximum observed across all pairs, indicating that this particular generated and manual CQ share some degree of semantic similarity, albeit relatively low. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.05 further suggests that there is minimal overlap in the actual content or terms used in the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for unique content or themes that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs and the manual CQs is not provided beyond the highest similarity pair, we can infer the following based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.27** and the average Jaccard similarity of **0.05** indicate that there is a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs. This suggests that many generated CQs may cover topics or ask questions that are not addressed in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of **0.00** indicates that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual CQs. This strongly suggests that there are likely many essential CQs in the generated set that are not captured in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a detailed review of the generated CQs to identify themes, topics, or specific questions that are not represented in the manual list. This could involve looking for questions related to:

- Specific functionalities or features of the ontology that are not mentioned in the manual.
- Queries about relationships between different entities within the ontology.
- Questions regarding the application or use cases of the ontology that may not be covered in the manual.

In summary, while we cannot specify the exact missing CQs without additional data, the analysis indicates that there are likely several essential questions in the generated set that are not reflected in the manual list, given the low similarity scores and the lack of matches with high cosine similarity.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.271841436624527,0.5610339641571045,Where is the documentation of [it]?,What are the subsets and their descriptions included in the EDAM ontology as defined in the SWO ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the different subsets included in the EDAM ontology, and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is [it] extensible?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.07**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common elements between the two questions when considering their token sets. 

The low cosine similarity suggests that while there may be some semantic overlap, it is minimal. The generated question is more complex and specific, while the manual question is very general and vague. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low similarity scores, it appears that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

Since the average cosine similarity is **0.07** and the maximum is also **0.07**, it indicates that the generated CQs are largely distinct from the manual CQs. The absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 further emphasizes that there are no significant overlaps in content or intent between the two sets.

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, one would typically look for:

- **Specificity**: Generated CQs that address specific aspects of the ontology, such as subsets, creators, or relationships, which may not be covered in the manual list.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Questions that pertain to the application, usage, or extensibility of the ontology, which may not be explicitly stated in the manual CQs.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is difficult to pinpoint specific missing questions. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify any essential questions that are not represented in the manual set. 

In summary, the generated CQs likely cover a broader range of topics and details related to the ontology that may not be captured in the manual list, indicating potential gaps in the manual CQs.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.06525625288486481,0.507920503616333,Is [it] extensible?,"What are the different subsets included in the EDAM ontology, and who are the creators associated with the SWO ontology?"

For example, if the generated CQs include questions about specific processes, relationships, or components that are not addressed in the manual list, they should be noted as missing.

- **Depth of Inquiry**: If the generated CQs delve into more complex or nuanced aspects of the subject matter (e.g., specific types of colloids, their applications, or their properties) that are not captured in the manual CQs, these should also be highlighted as essential missing questions.

- **Contextual Relevance**: If the generated CQs are relevant to current trends, research, or applications in the field that the manual CQs do not address, they may be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In summary, to identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a detailed comparison of the content and focus of the generated CQs against the manual CQs is necessary. This would involve examining the themes, specificity, and relevance of the questions to ensure that all critical areas of inquiry are covered. Without the actual list of manual CQs, it is difficult to specify which exact questions are missing, but the analysis should focus on the aspects mentioned above.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.17516033351421356,0.5932108163833618,Where do I categorise bulk like [this bulk]?,What are the components and relations involved in the formation of colloids within the ontology?

However, the high cosine similarity suggests that the semantic meaning of the questions is closely aligned, despite the lack of lexical overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific entities and relationships within the context of the African Wildlife Ontology, particularly regarding dietary relationships among animals.
- The manual CQs may not cover all the nuances or specific queries that could be derived from the ontology, especially if they are more general or do not delve into specific relationships or entities.

Based on the generated CQ provided, it appears that the manual list may be missing questions that:

1. **Specify Entities**: Questions that ask about specific entities (e.g., types of animals, plants, or other entities within the ontology) and their relationships.
2. **Contextual Relationships**: Questions that explore the relationships between different entities, such as predation, symbiosis, or other ecological interactions.
3. **Ontology-Specific Queries**: Questions that are tailored to the specific structure and content of the African Wildlife Ontology, which may include queries about classifications, habitats, or behaviors of animals.

For example, a few essential CQs that could be considered missing might include:

- ""What types of animals are classified as carnivores in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
- ""Which animals are known to be prey for specific predators according to the African Wildlife Ontology?""
- ""What are the dietary habits of herbivorous animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?""

These types of questions would enhance the manual list by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships and classifications within the ontology, which are crucial for users seeking detailed information.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.6580727100372314,0.5909957885742188,Which animal eats which other animal?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the entities that can be eaten by animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is [this animal] a herbivore?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.56**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. However, it is important to note that the Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common words or tokens between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be semantically related (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any lexical overlap.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for their content and intent. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of the African Wildlife Ontology, such as dietary habits of animals (e.g., herbivores) and possibly other ecological or biological relationships.
- The manual list appears to lack questions that explore the relationships between different entities within the ontology, such as:
  - Questions about predator-prey relationships (e.g., ""What animals are predators in the African Wildlife Ontology?"")
  - Questions about habitat or environmental conditions (e.g., ""What are the habitats of different species in the African Wildlife Ontology?"")
  - Questions regarding conservation status or threats to species (e.g., ""Which species in the African Wildlife Ontology are endangered?"")
  - Questions about the classification of animals (e.g., ""What are the classifications of animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?"")

Given the average cosine similarity of **0.56** and the lack of matches with a cosine similarity of **≥ 0.6**, it indicates that the generated CQs may be exploring dimensions of the ontology that are not fully represented in the manual list. Therefore, it would be beneficial to review the generated CQs for additional themes or topics that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list. 

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that cover broader ecological relationships, classifications, and conservation aspects related to the African Wildlife Ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5605746507644653,0.5805891752243042,Is [this animal] a herbivore?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00
- **BERTScore-F1**: 0.53
- **BLEU**: 0.00
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.08

This pair demonstrates the highest cosine similarity of 0.52, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity is 0.00, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. The BERTScore-F1 of 0.53 indicates that there is some semantic overlap when considering the contextual meaning of the words used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs may include broader or more specific inquiries that are not captured in the manual list. For example, questions about the relationships between different entities in the ontology or inquiries about the classification of animals and plants could be missing.
   
2. **Specificity in Dietary Habits**: The generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals suggests a focus on dietary habits, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. Questions that specify types of diets (e.g., carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous) or the ecological implications of these diets could be essential.

3. **Ontology-Specific Queries**: The reference to ""AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl"" in the generated CQ indicates a need for questions that are specific to the ontology being used. If the manual list does not include questions that leverage the ontology's structure or specific entities, this could represent a significant gap.

4. **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare different species or dietary preferences could also be missing. For instance, ""How do the dietary needs of herbivorous animals differ from those of carnivorous animals?"" could be an essential CQ that is not present in the manual list.

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the generated and manual CQs, there are likely essential questions related to dietary habits, ontology-specific inquiries, and comparative analyses that are missing from the manual list. These gaps could be addressed to enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5232784748077393,0.5322522521018982,Which plant parts does [this omnivorous or herbivorourus animal] eat?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?

The only pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Does a lion eat plants or plant parts?""
  
This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.60**, which is the maximum similarity score recorded across all pairs. However, it is important to note that the Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common words or tokens between the two questions. This suggests that while the semantic content of the questions is somewhat aligned (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they are expressed in very different terms.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Average cosine similarity** of **0.60** indicates that the generated CQs are somewhat aligned with the manual CQs, but the lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 (Precision@0.6 = 0.00) suggests that while the generated questions are similar to the manual ones, they do not overlap significantly in terms of content or phrasing.

- The **average Jaccard similarity** of **0.00** across all pairs indicates that there are no shared terms between the generated and manual CQs, which implies that the generated questions may be addressing similar topics but are phrased in a way that does not directly correspond to the manual questions.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing CQs that cover broader or different aspects of the topics addressed in the generated CQs. Specifically, the following types of essential CQs may be missing:

1. **Broader Taxonomic Questions**: Questions that explore the relationships between different species and their dietary habits, such as ""What types of animals are herbivores in the African Wildlife Ontology?"" or ""Which animals are known to be carnivorous?""

2. **Ecological Interactions**: Questions that delve into the ecological roles of different species, such as ""How do herbivores impact plant populations in the African ecosystem?"" or ""What is the role of predators in maintaining the balance of the African wildlife food web?""

3. **Specific Dietary Preferences**: Questions that focus on specific dietary preferences of various animals, such as ""What do elephants primarily eat in their natural habitat?"" or ""Which animals are known to consume fruits in the African savanna?""

4. **Cultural or Human Impact Questions**: Questions that consider the impact of human activities on wildlife diets, such as ""How does habitat destruction affect the dietary habits of African wildlife?""

In summary, while the generated CQs show some semantic similarity to the manual CQs, the lack of overlap in terms of specific wording and the absence of matches with high similarity scores suggest that the manual list may benefit from including a wider range of questions that address various ecological, dietary, and taxonomic aspects of African wildlife.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5962465405464172,0.5920840501785278,Does a lion eat plants or plant parts?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Is there an animal that does not drink water?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.44**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.05**, indicating that while there is some overlap in terms of content, it is relatively low. The similarity metrics suggest that while the questions are somewhat related, they focus on different aspects of animal behavior and ontology.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for unique concepts or queries that are not represented in the manual set. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.44** and the maximum of **0.44** indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated set may contain questions that explore different facets of the subject matter that are not captured in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: While the specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the complete list of generated CQs, we can hypothesize that essential questions related to:
  - Specific animal behaviors (e.g., feeding habits, habitats, interactions with other species)
  - Ecological relationships (e.g., predator-prey dynamics, symbiotic relationships)
  - Conservation status and threats to wildlife
  - Taxonomy and classification of species

These topics may not be adequately covered in the manual list, given the low similarity scores and the nature of the generated questions. 

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address broader ecological and behavioral aspects of wildlife, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Further analysis of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint specific questions that are absent from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.4442385733127594,0.49236351251602173,Is there an animal that does not drink water?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which plants eat animals?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.63**, which is the maximum cosine similarity recorded among all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common words between the two questions. However, the high cosine similarity suggests that the semantic meaning of the questions is closely aligned, likely due to the underlying concepts they address regarding food chains and dietary relationships in the context of wildlife.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for coverage of key topics, concepts, or relationships that are not represented in the manual list. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **High Cosine Similarity**: The generated CQs exhibit a high average cosine similarity (0.63) with the manual CQs, indicating that they are likely addressing similar themes or concepts. However, the Jaccard similarity of **0.00** suggests that the specific wording and phrasing differ significantly, which may indicate that the manual list lacks certain formulations or perspectives on the topics covered.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Since the generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals is focused on dietary relationships within the African Wildlife Ontology, it may imply that the manual list does not adequately cover questions related to:
  - Specific dietary relationships in ecosystems.
  - The role of different species in food webs.
  - The classification of entities (e.g., plants, animals) in the context of their ecological interactions.

- **Further Analysis Needed**: To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the themes and topics covered in the generated CQs versus the manual CQs would be necessary. This would involve examining the generated CQs for unique angles or questions that are not represented in the manual list, particularly those that explore ecological relationships, species interactions, and the implications of these interactions within the African Wildlife Ontology.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be pinpointed without additional context or a complete list of both generated and manual CQs, it is clear that the manual list may lack questions that explore the ecological and dietary relationships among species, particularly in the context of the African Wildlife Ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.6345731019973755,0.6318101286888123,Which plants eat animals?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.70**, which is the maximum cosine similarity recorded among all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.05**, indicating that while the two questions share some semantic content, they do not have a high degree of overlap in terms of the specific words used. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) might be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.70**, and the precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **1.00**, it suggests that the generated CQs are closely aligned with the manual CQs. However, the low Jaccard similarity (average of **0.05**) indicates that there may be significant differences in wording, which could imply that some essential concepts or questions are not captured in the manual list.

Here are some potential essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list based on the generated CQs:

1. **Specificity of Entities**: The generated CQs may include specific entities or categories that are not explicitly mentioned in the manual list. For example, questions that specify types of animals or specific behaviors (e.g., ""What types of prey do lions hunt according to the African Wildlife Ontology?"") might be absent.

2. **Contextual Relationships**: Generated CQs may explore relationships or interactions that are not covered in the manual list. For instance, questions about the ecological roles of certain animals or the impact of environmental changes on animal diets could be missing.

3. **Broader Ecological Questions**: The generated CQs might include broader ecological or conservation-related questions that are not present in the manual list, such as ""How do changes in habitat affect the dietary habits of African wildlife?""

4. **Temporal or Seasonal Aspects**: Questions that consider temporal factors, such as seasonal changes in animal diets or migration patterns, may also be missing.

5. **Comparative Questions**: Generated CQs might include comparative questions that ask about differences in diets among various species or regions, which may not be reflected in the manual list.

In summary, while the manual list may cover some fundamental aspects of animal diets, it may lack specificity, contextual relationships, broader ecological considerations, and comparative or temporal questions that are present in the generated CQs. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would help identify these gaps more precisely.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.703676164150238,0.6047658324241638,Which animals eat [these animals]?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.17

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.59, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.17 suggests that while there is some overlap in the terms used, the overall content and structure of the questions differ significantly.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision (0.00) for matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Entities and Relationships**: The generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals suggests a focus on the relationships between different species and their dietary habits. If the manual list does not include questions about prey and predator relationships or dietary classifications, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

2. **Specificity to the African Wildlife Context**: The generated CQ references the ""AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl,"" which implies a need for questions that are specific to African wildlife. If the manual list lacks questions that address specific species, habitats, or ecological interactions within this context, these would be essential to include.

3. **Broader Ecological Questions**: Questions that explore broader ecological concepts, such as food chains, ecosystem roles, or conservation status of species, may also be missing. These types of questions are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of wildlife interactions.

4. **Behavioral Aspects**: If the manual list does not include questions about animal behavior, such as hunting strategies or social structures, these could also be considered essential missing CQs.

In summary, the analysis suggests that the manual list may lack questions that cover dietary relationships, ecological specificity, broader ecological concepts, and behavioral aspects of wildlife, which are critical for a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5869876146316528,0.6010341644287109,Which animals are the predators of [these animals]?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?

However, it is important to note that while this score indicates some level of similarity, the Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. The BERTScore-F1 is **0.57**, indicating a moderate semantic similarity, while the ROUGE-L F1 score is **0.17**, which is relatively low. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Lack of High Similarity Matches**: The statistics indicate that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher, which suggests that the generated CQs may be significantly different from the manual CQs. This could imply that the manual list may not cover all the necessary topics or questions that the generated CQs address.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals suggests a focus on ecological or biological relationships, which may not be represented in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions related to ecological interactions, dietary relationships, or specific ontological queries about wildlife, these could be considered essential CQs that are missing.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated CQ is specific to the African Wildlife Ontology, indicating a need for questions that are contextually relevant to specific ontologies or domains. If the manual list does not include questions that reference specific ontologies or domain-specific knowledge, this could also represent a gap.

In summary, while we cannot definitively list the missing essential CQs without the actual content of the manual list, we can conclude that the manual list may lack questions that address ecological relationships, domain-specific inquiries, and potentially other areas of knowledge that the generated CQs cover.

However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.04 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual content or vocabulary used in the two questions. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be related in context (both discussing animals), they are phrased quite differently and focus on different aspects of the topic.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.04) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity in Animal Diets**: The generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals suggests a focus on dietary relationships within the African Wildlife Ontology. If the manual list does not include questions about animal diets or food chains, this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Ecological Relationships**: Questions that explore ecological relationships, such as predator-prey dynamics or symbiotic relationships, may also be missing. These are crucial for understanding wildlife interactions.

3. **Conservation Status**: CQs that inquire about the conservation status of certain animals or the impact of human activities on wildlife could be essential, especially in the context of the African Wildlife Ontology.

4. **Habitat and Distribution**: Questions regarding the habitats of various animals or their geographical distribution may also be absent. These are fundamental aspects of wildlife studies.

5. **Behavioral Aspects**: CQs that focus on animal behavior, such as migration patterns or social structures, could provide additional depth that is not captured in the manual list.

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the themes of the generated and manual CQs, there are likely essential questions related to animal diets, ecological relationships, conservation, habitat, and behavior that are not represented in the manual list.

However, the Jaccard similarity of 0.00 indicates that there are no shared words between the two questions, suggesting that while they may be semantically similar, they do not share lexical content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Entities and Relationships**: The generated CQ about entities that can be eaten by animals indicates a focus on dietary relationships within the ontology, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
2. **Ontology-Specific Queries**: The reference to ""AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl"" suggests that there may be specific queries related to the ontology's structure, classifications, or relationships that are not present in the manual list.
3. **Behavioral or Ecological Questions**: The generated CQ implies a focus on ecological interactions (e.g., what animals eat), which may not be captured by the manual's habitat-focused question.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some degree of similarity between the generated and manual CQs, the lack of lexical overlap and the low Jaccard similarity suggest that the generated CQs may explore different or additional dimensions of the subject matter. Therefore, it is likely that essential CQs related to dietary relationships, ontology-specific queries, and ecological interactions are missing from the manual list. Further examination of the generated CQs could help identify these gaps more comprehensively.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5202007293701172,0.5614358186721802,In what kind of habitat do [this animal] live?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and intent behind the generated CQs. Given that the generated CQ focuses on entities that can be eaten by animals, it suggests a need for questions that explore dietary relationships within the African Wildlife Ontology. 

Here are some potential essential CQs that could be considered missing from the manual list:

1. **Dietary Relationships**:
   - ""What types of food are consumed by different animal species in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
   - ""Which plants are known to be eaten by herbivorous animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?""

2. **Ecosystem Interactions**:
   - ""How do different animal species interact with their food sources in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
   - ""What are the predator-prey relationships among animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?""

3. **Conservation Status**:
   - ""What is the conservation status of various species in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
   - ""Which species are at risk due to habitat loss or dietary changes in the African Wildlife Ontology?""

4. **Habitat and Diet**:
   - ""What habitats support the dietary needs of animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?""
   - ""How does the availability of food sources affect animal populations in the African Wildlife Ontology?""

These questions would enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list by addressing various aspects of animal diets, interactions, and conservation, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics within the African Wildlife Ontology. The generated CQs suggest a focus on dietary relationships, which may not be fully represented in the manual list, indicating a gap that could be filled with these additional questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.582453727722168,0.64319908618927,Which animals are endangered?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the African Wildlife Ontology?

- **Manual CQ**: ""Do [this animal] and [this animal] live in the same habitat?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.49** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity indicates that the two questions share some semantic content, but the relatively low Jaccard similarity suggests that they do not share many common terms. This indicates that while the questions may be related in a broader context (e.g., discussing animals and their interactions), they are not closely aligned in terms of specific vocabulary or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.04) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

Some potential essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list might include:

- **Questions about relationships**: The generated CQs may include inquiries about the relationships between different entities, such as ""What are the predator-prey relationships among animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?"" This type of question is crucial for understanding ecological dynamics but may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.

- **Questions about classifications**: CQs that ask about the classification of entities, such as ""How are different species categorized in the African Wildlife Ontology?"" could be essential for users looking to understand the taxonomy of wildlife.

- **Questions about behaviors**: CQs that explore animal behaviors, such as ""What feeding behaviors are exhibited by animals in the African Wildlife Ontology?"" could provide insights into the ecological roles of different species.

- **Questions about habitats**: While the manual list includes a question about habitat, it may lack depth. For example, ""What types of habitats are represented in the African Wildlife Ontology?"" could be a critical question for users interested in environmental studies.

- **Questions about conservation status**: CQs that inquire about the conservation status of species, such as ""What species in the African Wildlife Ontology are endangered?"" would be vital for conservation efforts and are often overlooked in general queries.

In summary, the generated CQs likely encompass a broader range of topics and perspectives that are not fully captured in the manual list, particularly in areas related to relationships, classifications, behaviors, habitats, and conservation status.

- **Manual CQ**: ""Are there animals that are carnivore but still eat some plants or parts of plants?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.56** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.12**. The cosine similarity indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions, suggesting that they both pertain to the dietary habits of animals, albeit from slightly different angles. The generated question focuses on entities that can be consumed by animals, while the manual question inquires about the dietary flexibility of carnivorous animals.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and themes present in the generated CQs that are not reflected in the manual CQs. Given the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs, the following types of questions could be considered essential and potentially missing:

- **Questions about Specific Dietary Relationships**: The generated CQs may include inquiries about specific relationships between different species and their diets, such as ""What are the herbivorous animals in the AfricanWildlifeOntology?"" or ""Which animals are known to be omnivores in the AfricanWildlifeOntology?"" These questions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dietary classifications within the ontology.

- **Questions on Ecological Roles**: CQs that explore the ecological roles of different animals, such as ""What role do carnivores play in the ecosystem according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology?"" or ""How do herbivores impact plant populations in their habitats?"" These questions would address the broader ecological implications of animal diets.

- **Questions about Food Chains or Food Webs**: CQs that inquire about the relationships between different species in terms of food chains or food webs, such as ""What are the primary consumers in the AfricanWildlifeOntology?"" or ""Which animals are apex predators according to the ontology?"" These questions would help in understanding the dynamics of the ecosystem.

- **Questions on Dietary Adaptations**: CQs that focus on adaptations related to diet, such as ""What adaptations do animals have for consuming specific types of food?"" or ""How do seasonal changes affect the diets of animals in the AfricanWildlifeOntology?"" These questions would provide insights into the evolutionary aspects of animal diets.

In summary, while the manual list may cover some aspects of animal diets, it appears to lack depth in exploring specific dietary relationships, ecological roles, food chains, and adaptations, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5578726530075073,0.5410721898078918,Are there animals that are carnivore but still eat some plants or parts of plants?,What are the entities that can be eaten by animals according to the AfricanWildlifeOntology1.owl?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions is:

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""What are the protocol parts?""

**Similarity Scores:**
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.15
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.18

These scores indicate that while there is some degree of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.15, which suggests that this is the most similar pair in the entire dataset.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that many generated CQs do not have corresponding manual CQs.

**Key Observations:**
- The average cosine similarity of 0.15 and the maximum cosine similarity of 0.15 suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 indicates that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, which implies that the generated CQs are significantly different from the manual ones.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
While the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions might be essential and potentially missing based on common themes in competency questions:

1. **Definition and Scope Questions:**
   - Questions that define what constitutes a competency question or the scope of the dataset.

2. **Data Quality and Validation Questions:**
   - Questions that address how the data is validated or the criteria for data quality.

3. **Use Case and Application Questions:**
   - Questions that explore how the dataset can be applied in real-world scenarios or specific use cases.

4. **Comparison and Benchmarking Questions:**
   - Questions that compare this dataset with others or benchmark its performance.

5. **User Interaction Questions:**
   - Questions that inquire about how users can interact with the dataset or the tools available for querying it.

In summary, the generated CQs appear to lack alignment with the manual CQs, and essential questions related to definitions, data quality, use cases, comparisons, and user interactions may be missing from the manual list. Further analysis of the specific content of both sets would be necessary to identify exact missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1481592208147049,0.649421751499176,What are the protocol parts?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""What types of data are collected during medical and clinical consultation?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.27** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.08**. The cosine similarity score indicates that while there is some degree of similarity in the wording or structure of the questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the content or focus of the questions is quite different. The Jaccard similarity further supports this, as it is also low, indicating minimal overlap in the unique terms used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for their relevance and coverage of key topics that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs and the manual CQs is not provided in detail, we can infer the following based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores:** The average cosine similarity (0.27) and Jaccard similarity (0.08) suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or aspects covered by the generated CQs.

- **Precision@0.6:** The precision score of **0.00** indicates that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that essential questions that could be relevant to the domain or context of the manual CQs are likely missing.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to review the generated CQs in detail to see what topics, themes, or specific inquiries they address that are not reflected in the manual list. This could include questions about:

- Specific methodologies or frameworks for competency questions.
- Contextual applications of competency questions in various domains (e.g., healthcare, education).
- Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness or relevance of competency questions.
- Examples of competency questions that have been successfully implemented in practice.

In summary, while we cannot pinpoint exact missing CQs without the content of both sets, the analysis indicates that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled by the generated CQs.

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialised in this dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What types of demographic data are collected?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.25** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.10**. These values indicate that while there is some level of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.25 suggests that the questions share some common terms or concepts, but they are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic meaning or intent.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.25**, which indicates that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned overall.
- The precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **0.00**, meaning that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated questions are considered closely related to any in the manual.

Given that the maximum cosine similarity is also **0.25**, it implies that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs, indicating that essential questions may be missing from the manual list. 

To identify specific missing essential CQs, one would typically need to review the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, since the statistics indicate a lack of strong matches, it is reasonable to conclude that the manual list may not encompass all relevant topics or areas of inquiry that the generated CQs cover.

In summary, the essential CQs that are missing from the manual list are likely those that address different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are represented in the generated CQs but not captured in the manual set.

This pair represents the highest similarity across all pairs analyzed, with both metrics indicating a relatively low level of similarity. The cosine similarity of 0.28 suggests that while there is some overlap in the vector representations of the two questions, it is not substantial. The Jaccard similarity of 0.15 further confirms that the overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.28) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it indicates that the generated CQs may not align closely with the manual CQs. This suggests that there are likely essential competency questions that are present in the generated set but missing from the manual list.

To identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can consider the following:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of competency questions that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, questions about the criteria for formulating competency questions, their application in datasets, or their evaluation might be underrepresented in the manual list.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated CQs may include specific contexts or applications (e.g., ""in this dataset"") that are not captured in the manual CQs. This specificity can be crucial for understanding the practical implications of competency questions.

- **Conceptual Gaps**: The generated CQs might introduce new concepts or dimensions related to competency questions that are not reflected in the manual list. For example, questions about the relationship between competency questions and data quality, or their role in knowledge representation, could be missing.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be identified without the full content of both sets, it is clear that the generated CQs likely encompass a wider range of topics and specific contexts that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of competency questions.

The absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher indicates that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter compared to the manual list. This could imply that essential CQs that are relevant to the dataset or the domain of inquiry are missing from the manual list.

To identify specific essential CQs that might be missing, one would typically analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in the statistics, we can infer that:

- The manual list may lack questions that address specific aspects of the dataset, such as:
  - The context or application of the dataset.
  - Detailed inquiries about the methodology used to generate the dataset.
  - Questions regarding the implications or interpretations of the data contained within the dataset.
  - Queries about the relationships between different entities or variables present in the dataset.

- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the content or focus of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones.

Given these observations, it is likely that the generated CQs are not capturing key concepts or questions that are present in the manual list. However, without the actual content of the manual list of CQs, it is impossible to specify which essential CQs are missing.

To identify the missing essential CQs, one would need to:
- Review the manual list of CQs to identify key themes, topics, or questions that are not represented in the generated list.
- Compare the content of the generated CQs against the manual list to pinpoint specific areas where the generated CQs fall short.

In summary, while we can identify the pair with the highest similarity, determining the missing essential CQs requires access to the manual list for a direct comparison. The low similarity scores indicate that there are likely several important questions that have not been addressed in the generated set.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09421217441558838,0.7049563527107239,What are the types of diagnosis?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What types of cognitive abilities assessment data are collected?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.28
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.28, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.09 suggests that there is a low overlap in the actual terms used in both questions, which may imply that while the questions are related in context, they differ significantly in wording and specific focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision and lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it appears that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs.

**Key Observations**:
- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.28, which is relatively low, indicating that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity score that meets or exceeds 0.6 with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the generated CQs compared to the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the actual content of the manual list, we can infer that the following types of questions might be essential and potentially missing based on common themes in competency questions:

1. **Definition and Scope**: Questions that define what constitutes a competency question and the scope of the dataset.
2. **Data Sources**: Questions regarding where the data for the competencies is sourced from.
3. **Evaluation Criteria**: Questions that focus on how the competencies are evaluated or assessed.
4. **Use Cases**: Questions that explore the practical applications of the competencies in real-world scenarios.
5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Questions that inquire about who is involved in the creation and validation of the competencies.

In summary, the generated CQs appear to lack essential questions that cover foundational aspects of competency questions, their evaluation, and their application, which are typically critical in a comprehensive manual list. Further analysis of the specific content of both sets would be necessary to pinpoint exact missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.27911242842674255,0.6771575808525085,What types of cognitive abilities assessment data are collected?,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

This pair exhibits the highest similarity across all metrics evaluated, including cosine and Jaccard similarity. However, it is important to note that the similarity scores are relatively low overall, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- The generated CQs may include questions that address specific criteria, methodologies, or frameworks for evaluating competency questions, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
- For example, the generated CQ regarding the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized suggests a focus on the evaluation process, which may not be present in the manual list that seems to focus more on data collection (as seen in the MMSE question).

**Conclusion**:
To identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a thorough comparison of the themes and topics covered in both sets of CQs is necessary. The generated CQs likely introduce new dimensions or criteria for assessing competency questions that are not captured in the manual list, indicating a gap in the manual's comprehensiveness. Further analysis of the generated CQs would be required to explicitly list out these missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.20390188694000244,0.6510469913482666,What data are collected for MMSE,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for generated CQs that do not have a corresponding match in the manual set, particularly those that might be critical for the domain or context being addressed. Given the statistics provided, particularly the precision at a threshold of 0.6 being 0.00 and no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that none of the generated CQs closely align with the manual CQs.

Since the average cosine similarity is low and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list. 

To identify specific essential CQs that are missing, one would need to analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail. However, based on the provided data, it can be inferred that the manual list may lack coverage of the following potential areas:

- **Criteria for competency questions:** The generated CQ about the criteria for a competency question indicates a focus on the foundational aspects of what constitutes a valid CQ, which may not be addressed in the manual.
- **Contextual or domain-specific inquiries:** If the generated CQs include questions that pertain to specific datasets, methodologies, or applications relevant to the domain (e.g., UPDRS), these may also be missing from the manual list.

In summary, while specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the full list of generated CQs, it is clear that the manual list may not encompass the breadth of questions necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the topic, particularly in terms of foundational criteria and domain-specific inquiries.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1517278254032135,0.6206277012825012,What data are collected for UPDRS?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialised in this dataset?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What types of autonomy assessment data are collected?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.30
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

This pair represents the highest similarity across all pairs analyzed, with both metrics indicating a low level of similarity overall. The cosine similarity of 0.30 suggests that while there is some overlap in the vector space representation of the questions, it is still relatively low. The Jaccard similarity of 0.10 further confirms that the overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low cosine similarity scores and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Key Observations**:
- The generated CQs focus on specific criteria and assessments related to competency questions and their materialization in datasets, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual CQs.
- The manual CQs seem to focus on types of data collected, which may not encompass the broader criteria or evaluation aspects that the generated CQs are addressing.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Criteria for Materialization**: Questions that explore the criteria or standards for determining the relevance or materialization of competency questions in datasets.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Questions that inquire about the metrics or methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of competency questions.
3. **Contextual Relevance**: Questions that assess how competency questions relate to specific contexts or datasets, which may not be captured in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that appear to be missing from the manual list likely revolve around the evaluation, criteria, and contextual relevance of competency questions, which are critical for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The generated CQs may provide valuable insights that are not reflected in the manual CQs, indicating a gap in the manual's coverage of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.29734593629837036,0.6751964092254639,What types of autonomy assessment data are collected?,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

This pair represents the highest similarity across all evaluated pairs, but it is important to note that the similarity scores are relatively low overall. The maximum cosine similarity of 0.15 indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representations of the questions, it is not substantial. The Jaccard similarity of 0.04 further emphasizes the limited overlap in the actual content of the questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Key Observations**:
- The generated CQs focus on specific criteria and processes related to competency questions and their materialization, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual CQs.
- The manual CQs appear to be more focused on the steps involved in ecological assessments, which may not encompass the broader or more theoretical aspects of competency questions.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Criteria for Materialization**: Questions that explore the criteria or standards for what constitutes a valid or materialized competency question.
2. **Evaluation of Competency Questions**: Questions that assess how competency questions can be evaluated or validated within a dataset.
3. **Relationship to Ecological Assessment**: Questions that link competency questions directly to ecological assessments, exploring how they inform or shape the assessment process.

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs introduce new dimensions or considerations that are not captured in the manual list. Therefore, a thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list is necessary to identify specific essential questions that may be missing. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap between the generated and manual CQs, significant gaps exist, particularly in the theoretical and evaluative aspects of competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.14926284551620483,0.659027099609375,What types of steps does ecological assessment consist of?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Key Observations**:
- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific criteria and definitions (e.g., ""criteria for a CQ to be considered materialised""), which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list.
- The manual CQs appear to be more general or focused on broader categories (e.g., ""types of directed tasks""), which may overlook specific operational or definitional questions that are critical for understanding the dataset.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Criteria and Definitions**: Questions that seek to define what constitutes a valid CQ or the criteria for materialization in the dataset.
2. **Operational Questions**: Questions that address how CQs are operationalized or implemented within the context of the dataset.
3. **Contextual Questions**: Questions that explore the context in which the dataset is used or the implications of the CQs on data interpretation.

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs introduce new dimensions or specific inquiries that are not captured in the manual list. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific questions that are essential but missing. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap between the generated and manual CQs, there are likely essential questions related to criteria, definitions, and operational aspects that are not represented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.13658034801483154,0.6704607605934143,What are the types of directed tasks?,What are the criteria for a CQ to be considered materialised in this dataset?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""Which are the physical directed tasks?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.17
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.11

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, as evidenced by the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs being 0.17. This suggests that the generated and manual questions share some thematic elements but are largely distinct in their wording and focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, we can only infer that the following types of questions might be missing based on the generated CQs:

- **Criteria and Definitions:** Questions that seek to define what constitutes a competency question or the criteria for their materialization, as seen in the generated CQ about criteria for competency questions.
- **Contextual Applications:** Questions that explore how competency questions are applied in specific contexts or datasets, which may not be captured in the manual list.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Questions that compare different types of competency questions or their effectiveness in various scenarios.

To accurately identify the essential CQs that are missing, a direct comparison of the content of both sets of CQs would be necessary. This would involve examining the themes, topics, and specific wording of both the generated and manual CQs to identify gaps in coverage. Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that several essential questions related to the broader context of competency questions are not included in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.16629664599895477,0.6271826028823853,Which are the physical directed tasks?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.11

These values indicate that while there is some level of similarity, it is quite low overall, as evidenced by the maximum cosine and Jaccard similarities being only 0.11. This suggests that the content and focus of the questions are quite different, despite sharing some superficial linguistic features.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is only 0.11, it indicates a significant divergence between the two sets. 

Since the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, it suggests that none of the generated CQs closely match any of the manual CQs, indicating that there are likely several essential questions that are present in the generated set but not represented in the manual set.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is impossible to specify which essential CQs are missing. To identify the missing CQs, one would need to:

- Review the generated CQs and compare them against the manual CQs.
- Identify key themes or topics present in the generated CQs that are not addressed in the manual CQs.

In summary, the analysis indicates that there is a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs, suggesting that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of certain essential topics or questions that are present in the generated set.

Given that the average cosine similarity is low (0.18) and that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it indicates that the generated CQs may not closely align with the manual CQs.

Since the precision at 0.6 is 0.00 and there are no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or concepts represented in the generated CQs. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to compare the content of the generated CQs against the manual list. However, since the statistics indicate a significant gap in similarity, it can be inferred that the manual list may be missing essential questions that address the following areas:

- **Specificity of Competency Questions:** The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of competency questions, such as their materialization and presence in datasets. If the manual list does not include questions that probe into these specifics, it may be lacking.
  
- **Assessment Tasks:** The manual CQ regarding the ""counting backwards task"" suggests a focus on assessment methodologies. If the generated CQs include questions about various assessment tasks or methodologies that are not reflected in the manual, these would be considered missing.

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would include those that delve into the specifics of competency questions, their applications, and various assessment methodologies that are not captured in the existing manual CQs.

The Jaccard similarity of 0.19 further supports this, indicating that the overlap in unique terms is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the provided statistics, particularly the precision metrics, it appears that there are no pairs of generated competency questions (CQs) that have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This indicates that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs, suggesting that essential competency questions may be missing from the manual list.

Given the average cosine similarity of 0.20 and the maximum cosine similarity of 0.20, it can be inferred that the generated CQs are not effectively capturing the key concepts or questions that are present in the manual list. The lack of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher implies that the manual list may not encompass all relevant aspects of the domain being addressed by the generated CQs.

To identify specific essential CQs that may be missing, a more detailed analysis of the generated CQs would be necessary. This would involve examining the content of the generated CQs to determine if they address critical areas or topics that are not represented in the manual list. Without access to the full set of generated CQs and the manual list, it is not possible to pinpoint exact missing questions, but the overall low similarity scores suggest that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list.

The Jaccard similarity of 0.14 further emphasizes that the overlap in unique terms is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Precision@0.6:** 0.00 indicates that there are no pairs of generated and manual CQs that have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This suggests that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs, indicating a potential gap in the manual list.

- **Best-match cosine per generated CQ:** The minimum, maximum, and average cosine similarity for the best matches is 0.23, which is significantly lower than the threshold of 0.6. This further supports the idea that the manual list may be lacking in essential CQs that align closely with the generated ones.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the manual list does not cover key areas or concepts that the generated CQs address. However, without specific content from the manual list, we cannot definitively identify which essential CQs are missing. 

To identify the missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the topics, themes, and specific wording of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary. This would involve examining the content of the generated CQs to see what concepts or questions are not represented in the manual list.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

However, without access to the complete list of generated CQs and the manual CQs, we can only infer that the following types of questions might be missing based on the context provided:

- **Criteria and Evaluation**: The generated CQ about the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized suggests a focus on evaluation and assessment, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
  
- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQ's emphasis on the dataset indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding how CQs relate to specific datasets or contexts, particularly in terms of their applicability and relevance.

- **Functional Areas**: The manual CQ focuses on clinical relevance, which may imply that other functional areas or domains relevant to the dataset are not adequately represented in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely pertain to evaluation criteria, contextual relevance to datasets, and broader functional areas that are not captured by the existing manual CQs. A detailed comparison of the complete lists would be necessary to identify specific missing questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.07774366438388824,0.6487182974815369,What functional areas are of clinical relevance for the home and nursing home environments?,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- The generated CQ regarding the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized indicates a focus on the standards or benchmarks for evaluating CQs. If the manual list does not include questions that address the criteria or standards for competency questions, this could be a significant gap.
- Additionally, if there are generated CQs that explore the purpose, application, or context of competency questions in the dataset, these may also be missing from the manual list.

**Conclusion**:
To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the content and themes of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary. However, based on the provided statistics and the nature of the highest similarity pair, it is likely that questions related to the evaluation criteria and contextual application of competency questions are underrepresented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.40583986043930054,0.6806715130805969,What types of questionnaires are administered for self-assessment?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialised in this dataset?

In summary, to identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a detailed comparison of the content of the generated CQs against the manual CQs would be necessary. This would involve examining the themes, specificity, and contextual relevance of the questions in both sets. Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that several essential CQs from the generated set are not represented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.12664306163787842,0.6638670563697815,What activities (situations) are of clinical interest with respect to ADLs?,What are the specific conditions under which a competency question is considered materialized in this dataset?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What information is of clinical interest regarding food and drink preparation?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.16
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.16, which indicates a very low level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity of 0.04 further confirms that there is minimal overlap in the terms used in both questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.16, which is quite low, indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated CQs are not capturing the essential concepts or information that the manual CQs are addressing.

Given these observations, it can be inferred that the generated CQs may be lacking in key areas that are represented in the manual list. However, without access to the specific content of the manual list of CQs, it is impossible to identify the exact missing questions.

To summarize, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would be those that address critical aspects of the domain that are not reflected in the generated CQs. These could include questions that focus on specific clinical interests, data requirements, or contextual factors relevant to the dataset in question. A detailed review of both sets of CQs would be necessary to pinpoint the exact missing elements.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1608823537826538,0.6557067632675171,What information is of clinical interest regarding food and drink preparation?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the materialised competency questions present in this dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What information is of clinical interest regarding food and drink consumption?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.18
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

This indicates that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low across the metrics used. The cosine similarity of 0.18 suggests that the vectors representing these questions have some overlap, but they are not closely aligned in meaning. The Jaccard similarity of 0.05 further emphasizes that the overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.18) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it can be inferred that there are significant gaps between the generated and manual lists of competency questions. 

The following points can be made regarding the essential competency questions that may be missing from the manual list:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated questions seem to cover a broader range of topics, particularly focusing on the structure and content of the dataset itself (e.g., ""materialised competency questions""). If the manual list is primarily focused on clinical aspects (as indicated by the example provided), it may lack questions that address the dataset's metadata, structure, or other non-clinical aspects.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated questions may include specific inquiries about the dataset that are not present in the manual list. For instance, questions about the methodology of data collection, the types of data included, or the intended use of the dataset could be essential for users who are looking to understand the dataset's applicability.

- **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: If the generated questions touch on interdisciplinary aspects (e.g., how the dataset can be used in various fields beyond clinical interest), these may not be reflected in the manual list, which appears to be more narrowly focused.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential competency questions that address the dataset's structure, methodology, and broader applicability, which are crucial for users seeking comprehensive understanding and utilization of the dataset. Further analysis of the generated questions could help identify specific areas where the manual list could be expanded to include these essential inquiries.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.18497422337532043,0.6518799066543579,What information is of clinical interest regarding food and drink consumption?,What are the materialised competency questions present in this dataset?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""What information is of clinical interest regarding housekeeping?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.13
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.10

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, as evidenced by the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs being only 0.13. This suggests that the generated and manual questions are not closely aligned in terms of their content or focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for unique themes, topics, or questions that are not represented in the manual set. However, since the statistics indicate that the best-match cosine similarity is quite low (with no matches having a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher), it suggests that the generated CQs may not closely align with the manual CQs.

Given the lack of high similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not captured in the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to extract themes or questions that are not present in the manual list. This could involve looking for:
- Questions that address different stakeholders or perspectives.
- Queries that explore different dimensions of the dataset or domain that are not covered in the manual questions.
- Areas of inquiry that are emerging or relevant in the current context but are absent from the manual list.

Since the provided data does not include the actual content of the generated CQs or the manual CQs beyond the one pair mentioned, a detailed identification of missing essential CQs cannot be performed without that context. However, the low similarity scores suggest that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled by the generated CQs. 

In summary, while we can identify the pair with the highest similarity, a thorough examination of the generated CQs is necessary to pinpoint specific essential questions that are missing from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.12584847211837769,0.6524181365966797,What information is of clinical interest regarding housekeeping?,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.10
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

These values represent the highest similarity observed across all pairs, but they are still quite low, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or phrasing.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for generated CQs that do not have a corresponding match in the manual list, especially those that might be critical for the domain or context being addressed. 

Given the statistics provided, particularly the precision metrics and the fact that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

Since the average cosine similarity across all pairs is only 0.10, and there are no pairs with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it implies that many essential CQs from the generated set may not be represented in the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the provided data, it is clear that there is a significant gap between the two sets, indicating that many potentially essential CQs from the generated list are likely missing from the manual list.

In summary, while specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the actual content of both lists, the analysis indicates a substantial lack of overlap and suggests that the manual list may not comprehensively cover the necessary competencies represented in the generated questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.09793412685394287,0.6625993847846985,What information is of clinical interest regarding personal hygiene?,What are the criteria for determining if a competency question is materialized in this dataset?

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.05
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.17

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low overall. The cosine similarity of 0.05 suggests that the vector representations of the two questions are very close to orthogonal, indicating minimal overlap in their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity of 0.17, while higher than the cosine similarity, still reflects a limited degree of shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for content that is not represented in the manual CQs. However, since the statistics indicate that the generated CQs have very low similarity scores (particularly with a maximum cosine similarity of 0.05 and no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6), it suggests that the generated CQs may not align well with the manual CQs.

Given the lack of high similarity, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list. To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to see if they address key areas or questions that are essential for the domain but are absent in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that are missing would be those that:
- Address specific criteria or conditions relevant to the domain that are not reflected in the manual CQs.
- Explore different facets of the subject matter that may not have been considered in the manual generation process.

Without the actual content of the generated CQs, it is not possible to list specific missing questions, but the analysis indicates that there is a significant gap in alignment between the two sets.

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.01
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.17

Despite being the highest similarity pair, the values indicate a very low level of similarity overall. The cosine similarity of 0.01 suggests that the vector representations of the questions are nearly orthogonal, indicating minimal overlap in their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity of 0.17, while higher than the cosine similarity, still reflects a low degree of shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.01, indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the content or focus of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones.

Given these observations, it can be inferred that essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list include:

- CQs that address specific criteria or standards for competency questions, as indicated by the generated CQ about materialization.
- CQs that focus on behavioral indicators related to food and drink consumption, which are present in the manual CQ but not reflected in the generated set.

Since the generated CQs do not align closely with the manual CQs, it is likely that a comprehensive review of the domain and context of the manual CQs is necessary to identify specific topics or questions that should be included in the generated set. This could involve:
- Identifying key themes or topics that are prevalent in the manual CQs but absent in the generated ones.
- Ensuring that the generated CQs cover a broader range of scenarios or contexts relevant to the domain of interest.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores (with the highest being 0.08), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not addressed in the manual list.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is difficult to specify which essential CQs are missing. Generally, one would look for the following types of questions that might be missing:

- **Specificity**: Questions that ask for detailed information about the dataset or its components, which may not be present in the manual list.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Questions that relate to current issues or scenarios that are relevant to the dataset but are not reflected in the manual CQs.
- **Operational Queries**: Questions that focus on how to utilize the dataset effectively, which may be absent if the manual CQs are more theoretical or broad.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the generated CQs introduce new angles or specific inquiries that the manual list does not cover. To identify these missing CQs accurately, a direct comparison of the content of both sets would be necessary.

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for generated CQs that do not have a corresponding match in the manual list, especially those that might be critical for the domain or context being addressed. Given the statistics provided, particularly the precision metrics and the lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it appears that there are no generated CQs that closely align with the manual CQs.

Since the average cosine similarity is very low (0.07) and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may not effectively capture the essential questions that are present in the manual list. 

To identify specific missing essential CQs, one would need to analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail. However, based on the provided data, it can be inferred that the generated CQs may not adequately cover the necessary topics or areas of inquiry that are represented in the manual list. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that there is a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs, with no essential CQs from the generated list being identified as matching or complementing those in the manual list. Further qualitative analysis of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint specific missing questions that are critical for the domain.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.07206181436777115,0.6249960660934448,What activities (situations) are of clinical interest with respect to physical activity?,What are the criteria for a CQ to be considered materialised in this dataset?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialised in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""What information is clinically relevant for walking?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.16
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.10

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, as evidenced by the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs being only 0.16. This suggests that the generated and manual questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores (particularly the maximum cosine similarity of 0.16 and the average cosine similarity of 0.16), it suggests that the generated CQs may not effectively capture the key concepts or information that the manual CQs address.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is challenging to identify specific missing questions. Generally, essential CQs that might be missing could include:

- Questions that address fundamental concepts or definitions relevant to the domain of interest.
- Questions that explore relationships between different entities or concepts within the dataset.
- Questions that inquire about the implications or applications of the data in practical scenarios.

To accurately identify the missing essential CQs, a detailed comparison of the content and themes of both the generated and manual CQs would be necessary. This would involve examining the topics covered in the manual list and identifying any significant areas that are not represented in the generated set. 

In summary, while we can identify the pair with the highest similarity, determining the specific essential CQs that are missing requires further context regarding the content of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.15863385796546936,0.6403483748435974,What information is clinically relevant for walking?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialised in this dataset?

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.28, which indicates a moderate level of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.09 suggests that there is a low overlap in the actual content or terms used in the questions. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be conceptually related, they differ significantly in their wording and specific focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.28) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Data Retrieval**: The generated CQ about retrieving specific information from datasets indicates a focus on data extraction and usability, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
2. **Materialized Views**: The mention of ""materialised competency questions"" in the generated CQ suggests a technical aspect related to data representation that may not be present in the manual CQs.
3. **Clinical Relevance**: While the manual CQ addresses clinical relevance, the generated CQs may include broader or different contexts that are not captured in the manual list.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some similarity between the generated and manual CQs, the overall alignment is low, suggesting that the manual list may be missing essential questions that address specific aspects of data retrieval, technical representations, and broader contexts. Further examination of the generated CQs could help identify additional relevant questions that enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.282945454120636,0.6642338037490845,What information is clinically relevant for dedicated physical activities (i.e. exercises)?,What specific information can be retrieved from the dataset using materialised competency questions?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.20) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQs may include questions that address specific contexts or conditions under which certain data or information is relevant, which may not be captured in the manual list.
2. **Materialization of CQs**: The generated CQ about the conditions for materialization indicates a focus on the criteria or standards for defining competency questions, which may be absent in the manual list.
3. **Specificity in Assessment**: The generated CQs might delve into specific methodologies or frameworks for assessing competencies, which could be lacking in the manual CQs.

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the manual list does not encompass the full range of inquiries that the generated CQs present. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific questions that are essential but missing. 

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be pinpointed without the full list of generated CQs, the analysis indicates that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list regarding contextual relevance, materialization criteria, and specific assessment methodologies.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.20475277304649353,0.657418966293335,What information is clinically relevant for physical activity assessment?,What are the specific conditions under which a competency question is considered materialized in this dataset?

- **Generated:** ""What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialised in this dataset?""
- **Manual:** ""What physical activity related situations indicate a problem or possibly problematic behaviour that needs to be highlighted to the clinician?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.13
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.17

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, suggesting that the content and focus of the questions differ significantly. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.13, indicating that this is the highest similarity observed in the entire analysis.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.13, and the maximum is also 0.13, indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the content or focus of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones.

Given these observations, it can be inferred that essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list could include:

- CQs that address specific criteria or standards for competency questions, as indicated by the generated CQ about materialization.
- CQs that focus on the evaluation of behaviors or situations in clinical contexts, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list based on the provided example.

To identify specific missing CQs, a more detailed comparison of the content and themes of both sets would be necessary. However, based on the low similarity scores, it is clear that there are likely several essential CQs that have not been captured in the manual list, particularly those that align with the themes of competency evaluation and clinical assessment.

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.26
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.23

This indicates that while there is some degree of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.26 suggests that the questions share some common terms or concepts, but they are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic meaning. The Jaccard similarity of 0.23 further supports this, indicating that the overlap in unique terms is limited.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.26) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it can be inferred that there are likely several essential competency questions (CQs) that are present in the generated list but are missing from the manual list. 

The following points can be made regarding the missing CQs:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of the dataset that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, the generated CQ about ""materialized competency questions"" suggests a focus on the practical application or implementation of CQs, which may not be reflected in the manual list that focuses on more general or foundational questions like ""main types of entities.""

- **Specificity vs. Generality**: The generated questions may include more specific inquiries that delve into particular details or functionalities of the dataset, while the manual list may contain more general questions. This could indicate a gap in the manual list regarding detailed or nuanced aspects of the dataset.

- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQs may also be more contextually relevant to current trends or needs in the field, which may not be captured in the manual list. This could suggest that the manual list may need to be updated or expanded to include contemporary issues or emerging topics.

In conclusion, while the exact missing CQs cannot be identified without the full content of both lists, the analysis indicates that the manual list may lack specificity, diversity, and contextual relevance that are present in the generated CQs. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs in detail to identify specific questions that could enhance the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",0.2646821439266205,0.7296707630157471,What are the main types of entities?,What are the materialized competency questions present in the dataset?

The cosine similarity of 0.06 suggests that the vector representations of the questions are quite different, while the Jaccard similarity of 0.16 indicates a slightly higher overlap in terms of shared terms or tokens.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is very low (0.06), indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps between the two sets.

Given that the maximum cosine similarity is also 0.06, it is evident that the generated CQs do not align well with the manual CQs. The absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher indicates that essential CQs that might be present in the generated set are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to review the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the provided statistics, it can be inferred that the manual list lacks coverage of the topics or questions represented in the generated set, particularly those that might address specific criteria, definitions, or contextual inquiries related to competency questions.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely include those that explore the criteria for competency questions, their materialization, and other nuanced inquiries that are not captured in the manual set.

Given the low similarity scores (particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.16 and the precision at 0.6 being 0.00), it appears that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs. 

Since there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or questions that the generated CQs address. 

To identify specific essential CQs that might be missing, we would need to review the content of the generated CQs in detail. However, based on the provided data, we can infer that the manual list may not adequately cover the following areas:

- **Criteria for competency questions:** The generated CQ about the criteria for a competency question indicates a focus on the foundational aspects of what constitutes a valid question in the context of the dataset.
- **Materialization of competency questions:** The generated CQ also touches on the concept of materialization, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list.
- **Descriptive information relevance:** The manual CQ about descriptive information may not encompass the broader context of competency questions and their application in datasets.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address the criteria, materialization, and relevance of competency questions in the context of the dataset, as indicated by the generated CQs. A thorough review of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific questions that should be included in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.16316866874694824,0.7042072415351868,What types of descriptive information are relevant to a report?,What are the criteria for a competency question to be considered materialized in this dataset?

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.40 and the maximum of 0.40 indicate that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated set may contain questions that explore different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not captured in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of 0.00 for matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicates that there are no pairs of questions that are closely aligned (i.e., with a high degree of similarity). This further suggests that the manual list may be lacking in certain areas that the generated CQs are attempting to address.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific details that are not present in the manual list. For example, questions about specific components, operations, or relationships within the ontology may be missing.

To identify specific essential CQs that are missing, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to see what themes or topics they address that are not reflected in the manual list. This could include:

- Questions about specific data types or components that are relevant to the ontology.
- Inquiries into relationships or operations that are not explicitly mentioned in the manual CQs.
- Exploration of use cases or applications of the ontology that may not be covered.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be identified without the full list of generated CQs, the analysis indicates that the manual list may benefit from a review and inclusion of questions that address a wider range of topics and details relevant to the ontology in question.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3975030481815338,0.6341016888618469,What is the set of datatypes that have [a characterizing operation X]?,What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the dematerialised components highlighted in the OntoDT ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the set of datatypes that have [a datatype quality X] and [characterizing operation Y]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.39
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.39, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low overall. The Jaccard similarity is also quite low at 0.09, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique terms or phrases is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Precision@0.6**: 0.00, indicating that there are no pairs of generated and manual CQs with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This suggests that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs, which may imply that the manual list is lacking in coverage of the topics or types of questions represented in the generated list.

- **Average Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.39 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.09 indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. The low average scores suggest that the manual list may not encompass the full range of questions that could be relevant to the domain.

Given these observations, the following essential CQs may be missing from the manual list:

1. **Domain-Specific Queries**: Questions that specifically address components, attributes, or relationships within the OntoDT ontology that are not captured in the manual list. For example, queries about specific data types, their properties, or how they interact with other components in the ontology.

2. **Operational Queries**: Questions that inquire about operations or transformations that can be performed on the data types or components within the ontology. The generated CQ about ""dematerialised components"" suggests a focus on specific operational aspects that may not be reflected in the manual list.

3. **Contextual Queries**: Questions that explore the context or application of the ontology in real-world scenarios, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.

4. **Comparative Queries**: Questions that compare different components or data types within the ontology, which could provide insights into their relationships or differences.

In summary, the manual list appears to be lacking in coverage of specific, operational, contextual, and comparative questions that are relevant to the domain of the OntoDT ontology, as indicated by the low similarity scores and the absence of high-precision matches.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.38701045513153076,0.5932177305221558,What is the set of datatypes that have [a datatype quality X] and [characterizing operation Y]?,What are the dematerialised components highlighted in the OntoDT ontology?

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the metrics provided, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the aggregated datatypes that have [an aggregate generator property X]?""

**Similarity Scores**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.32
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.17

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar, as evidenced by the relatively low cosine and Jaccard similarity scores. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.32, which suggests that this is the only pair that reached this level of similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can consider the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.32 and the maximum of 0.32 suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This could imply that the generated set includes questions that are conceptually relevant but not captured in the manual set.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated questions are deemed sufficiently similar to any manual questions.

- **Diversity of Topics**: Given the nature of the generated CQs, it is possible that they cover topics or aspects of the domain that are not addressed in the manual list. For example, if the generated CQs include questions about specific components, properties, or relationships that are not mentioned in the manual CQs, these would be considered essential missing questions.

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to compare their content against the manual list. This would involve looking for unique topics, terminologies, or concepts that appear in the generated set but are absent in the manual set.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the highest similarity pair is between a generated CQ about dematerialised components and a manual CQ about aggregated datatypes, both showing low similarity scores. Furthermore, the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher indicates that there are likely essential CQs missing from the manual list, which could be identified through a more thorough comparison of the content of both sets.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3210803270339966,0.6334757804870605,What are the aggregated datatypes that have [an aggregate generator property X]?,What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the set of aggregate properties for [an aggregate datatype X]?""

**Similarity Scores**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.33
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.11

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, the similarity is relatively low, particularly in terms of Jaccard similarity, which suggests that the overlap in unique terms is minimal. The cosine similarity score of 0.33 indicates a moderate level of similarity in the vector space representation of the questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the overall statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given that the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.33 and that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may not align closely with the manual CQs.

**Key Observations**:
- The average similarity scores (cosine, Jaccard, BLEU, ROUGE-L) are quite low, indicating that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic than those in the manual list.
- The absence of any matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or questions that the generated CQs address.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity in Ontology Components**: The generated CQ about ""dematerialised components"" suggests a focus on specific elements within an ontology that may not be addressed in the manual list.
2. **Data Type Aggregation**: The mention of ""aggregate properties"" in the manual CQ indicates a focus on data types, which may not be fully explored in the generated CQs.
3. **Contextual Relationships**: If the generated CQs include questions about relationships or interactions between components in the ontology, these may not be represented in the manual list.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the highest similarity pair has a cosine similarity of 0.33, indicating a moderate level of semantic overlap. However, the overall low similarity scores suggest that the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address specific components, data types, and contextual relationships within the ontology. Further exploration of the generated CQs could help identify these gaps and enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.33171015977859497,0.6516836881637573,What is the set of aggregate properties for [an aggregate datatype X]?,What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?

- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the field components for [a tuple datatype X]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.39**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.03**, indicating a very low overlap in terms of shared terms. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.39) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
- **Complexity and Compliance**: The generated CQ regarding the OntoDT ontology and its compliance with the ISO/IEC 11404 standard indicates a focus on standards and complex data types, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions addressing the representation and reasoning of complex datatypes in compliance with specific standards, this could be a significant gap.
  
- **Specificity of Data Types**: The generated CQ's emphasis on ""arbitrary complex datatypes"" suggests a need for more specific questions about various data types and their representations. If the manual list does not include questions that explore different types of datatypes or their specific components, this could be another area where essential CQs are missing.

- **Reasoning Capabilities**: The generated CQ also touches on reasoning capabilities within the context of the ontology. If the manual list does not include questions that explore how the ontology can be used for reasoning about data, this could represent a critical omission.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely revolve around:
- Compliance with standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 11404).
- Representation of complex datatypes.
- Reasoning capabilities of the ontology.

To fully assess the missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the content and focus of both the generated and manual lists would be necessary. This would help identify specific areas where the manual list may lack comprehensive coverage of the domain's requirements.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 5.0}]",0.39326953887939453,0.5974059700965881,What are the field components for [a tuple datatype X]?,How can the OntoDT ontology be used to represent and reason about arbitrary complex datatypes in compliance with the ISO/IEC 11404 standard?

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the base datatype for [a set datatype X]?""
  
This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.37** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.12**. The cosine similarity score of 0.37 indicates a moderate level of similarity between the two questions, suggesting that they share some common semantic features or keywords, but they are not highly aligned in terms of their overall structure or intent.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated CQs may be significantly different from the manual ones, and there may be important questions that are not represented in the manual list.

- **Average Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.37** and the maximum cosine similarity of **0.37** suggest that while there is some overlap, the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs. The low average Jaccard similarity of **0.12** and BLEU score of **0.03** further indicate that the generated questions are not closely aligned with the manual questions in terms of shared vocabulary or phrasing.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing essential CQs that cover specific aspects of the domain or ontology that the generated CQs are addressing. To identify these missing CQs, one would need to:

- Review the generated CQs for unique topics or angles that are not represented in the manual list.
- Consider the context and domain of the ontology to ensure that all relevant areas are covered by the manual CQs.

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some similarity between the generated and manual CQs, there are likely essential questions that are not captured in the manual list, particularly given the low precision and similarity scores.

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.12

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.35, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.12 suggests that there is a low overlap in the unique terms used in both questions, further indicating that while the questions may be related in context, they differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.35) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQs may include questions that address specific components or features of the OntoDT ontology that are not captured in the manual list. For example, questions about specific relationships, properties, or instances within the ontology could be missing.
  
2. **Functional Queries**: Questions that explore the functionality or application of the ontology, such as ""How can the OntoDT ontology be utilized in data integration?"" or ""What are the advantages of using dematerialised components in OntoDT?"" may not be present in the manual list.

3. **Comparative Questions**: Queries that compare the OntoDT ontology with other ontologies or data models, such as ""How does OntoDT differ from traditional data models?"" could also be missing.

4. **Implementation Questions**: Questions that focus on the practical aspects of implementing or using the ontology, such as ""What tools are available for working with the OntoDT ontology?"" or ""What are the best practices for integrating OntoDT into existing systems?"" might not be included.

5. **User-Centric Questions**: Questions that consider the end-user perspective, such as ""What challenges do users face when working with the OntoDT ontology?"" or ""What resources are available for learning about OntoDT?"" could also be absent.

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap between the generated and manual CQs, there are likely several essential questions related to the OntoDT ontology that are not represented in the manual list, particularly those that delve into specific functionalities, comparisons, implementations, and user experiences.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3453959822654724,0.6209297776222229,What is the base datatype for [an extended datatype X]?,What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?

- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the subtype generator for [an extended datatype X]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.31
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.12

This pair represents the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs, which is relatively low (0.31). The Jaccard similarity is also low (0.12), indicating that while there is some overlap in the terms used, the overall content and context of the questions are quite different.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the low similarity scores across the board, particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.31 and the precision at 0.6 being 0.00, it suggests that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This could imply that there are essential CQs that are present in the generated list but are missing from the manual list.

To identify the essential CQs that might be missing, we would typically look for:

- **Key Concepts**: Any fundamental concepts or topics that are addressed in the generated CQs but not in the manual CQs.
- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of the ontology that are not represented in the manual list.
- **Specificity**: The generated CQs may include specific queries that are not captured in the manual list, which could be critical for comprehensive coverage of the subject matter.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, we cannot definitively list the missing essential CQs. A thorough review of both sets of CQs would be necessary to identify specific topics or questions that are underrepresented or absent in the manual list.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the highest similarity pair has a low cosine similarity score, indicating a lack of strong alignment between the generated and manual CQs.

The Jaccard similarity score of 0.14 suggests that there is some overlap in the terms used, but it is relatively low, indicating that the questions are not very similar in terms of their exact wording or structure.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs in relation to the domain or context they are addressing. Given the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.31 and the maximum of 0.31 suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or aspects covered by the generated CQs.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of 0.00 at a threshold of 0.6 indicates that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that there are likely essential questions that are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to analyze the content of the generated CQs in detail. However, based on the provided statistics, we can conclude that:

- **Potential Missing Topics**: The generated CQs may cover specific aspects of the OntoDT ontology, such as:
  - The nature and characteristics of dematerialized components.
  - The relationships between different datatypes and their generation processes.
  - Queries related to the application or implications of these datatypes in practical scenarios.

- **Recommendation for Review**: A thorough review of the generated CQs should be conducted to identify any unique questions that address these topics or any other relevant areas that are not captured in the manual list. This would help ensure that the manual CQs are comprehensive and cover all essential aspects of the domain.

In summary, the analysis indicates that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list of CQs, and a detailed examination of the generated CQs is necessary to identify and incorporate these missing essential questions.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.31146925687789917,0.658307671546936,What is the set of extended datatypes that are generated by [a subtype generator X]?,What are the dematerialised components represented in the OntoDT ontology?

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.41, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.04 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual words used in the two questions, which may indicate that while the questions are related in topic, they differ significantly in phrasing and specific focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Lack of High Similarity Matches**: The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.41, and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This indicates that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not addressed in the manual list.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQ regarding ""metadata elements"" suggests a focus on the structural and descriptive aspects of music data, which may not be captured in the manual CQ that focuses on identifying a composer. This indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that explore the metadata, relationships, and attributes of musical entities.

- **Potential Missing CQs**:
  - Questions that explore relationships between different musical entities (e.g., ""What are the relationships between composers, compositions, and performances in the Music Meta ontology?"")
  - Questions that inquire about specific attributes of musical works (e.g., ""What attributes are associated with a musical composition in the Music Meta ontology?"")
  - Questions that address the categorization or classification of music (e.g., ""How are different genres of music classified in the Music Meta ontology?"")

This suggests that while the questions may be semantically related, they differ significantly in their specific wording and structure.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.49, which indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. The maximum cosine similarity is also 0.49, suggesting that there is a lack of strong matches overall.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list regarding the coverage of topics or aspects addressed by the generated CQs.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of the Music Meta ontology that are not represented in the manual list. For example, the generated CQ about metadata attributes encompasses a wider scope (artists, compositions, performances, recordings) compared to the more focused manual CQ about the language of a music artist's name/alias.

**Conclusion**: 

To identify the essential CQs missing from the manual list, a detailed review of the generated CQs is necessary. This review should focus on identifying unique topics, attributes, or relationships that are present in the generated CQs but absent in the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores and the lack of matches above the cosine threshold of 0.6, it is likely that the manual list does not fully capture the breadth of inquiries that could be made regarding the Music Meta ontology. 

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that address:
- Metadata attributes for various entities (artists, compositions, performances, recordings).
- Relationships between different entities within the ontology.
- Specific queries about the properties and characteristics of music-related data that are not covered by the existing manual CQs. 

A comprehensive review of the generated CQs would help in identifying these gaps more explicitly.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.4893571734428406,0.6348763704299927,Which is the language of the name/alias of a music artist?,"What are the metadata attributes described by the Music Meta ontology for artists, compositions, performances, and recordings?"

The cosine similarity of 0.18 is the maximum observed across all pairs, and the Jaccard similarity of 0.04 is also the highest, but still indicates minimal overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Domain-Specific Metadata**: The generated CQ about ""metadata elements described by the Music Meta ontology"" indicates a focus on specific attributes and properties relevant to music. If the manual list lacks questions that explore metadata, attributes, or classifications within the music domain, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ may imply a need for questions that compare different entities (e.g., artists vs. compositions) or their relationships. If the manual list does not include questions that facilitate such comparisons, it may be missing essential analytical perspectives.

3. **Functional Queries**: The generated CQ hints at functional aspects of the ontology, such as how metadata is utilized or the implications of different metadata elements. If the manual list does not address functional or operational queries regarding the use of the ontology, this could represent a critical omission.

4. **Contextual Questions**: Questions that explore the context in which the metadata is applied (e.g., in music discovery, recommendation systems, or archiving) may also be missing. These questions are essential for understanding the practical applications of the ontology.

5. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: If the manual list does not include questions that connect music metadata to other domains (e.g., how music metadata interacts with other forms of media or data), this could indicate a lack of interdisciplinary inquiry.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address specific metadata elements, comparative analyses, functional queries, contextual applications, and interdisciplinary connections within the music domain.

- **BLEU**: 0.00
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.17

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.33 among all pairs, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity. However, the Jaccard similarity is 0.00, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. The BERTScore-F1 of 0.57 indicates a reasonable level of semantic overlap when considering contextual embeddings, while the ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.17 suggests some degree of overlap in longer sequences of words.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is relatively low (0.33), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Metadata Attributes**: The generated CQ about metadata attributes for artists, compositions, performances, and recordings indicates a focus on the structured data aspects of music. If the manual list lacks questions that explore metadata or data attributes, this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Ontology Specificity**: The generated CQ references the ""Music Meta ontology,"" which suggests a need for questions that delve into the specifics of how music is categorized or described within that ontology. If the manual list does not include questions about ontological frameworks or classifications, this is another area that may be missing.

3. **Performance Context**: The manual CQ about where a musical piece was performed focuses on the context of performance. However, there may be other contextual questions related to performances, such as ""What are the different types of performances in music?"" or ""How do performances vary by genre?"" that could be essential.

4. **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare different aspects of music, such as ""How do metadata attributes differ between genres?"" or ""What are the relationships between artists and their compositions?"" may also be missing.

5. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions that address the temporal aspects of music, such as ""How has the representation of music in metadata evolved over time?"" could provide valuable insights that are not captured in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore metadata attributes, ontological frameworks, performance contexts, comparative aspects, and temporal changes in music representation. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions related to music.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.3339541554450989,0.5710803866386414,Where was a musical piece performed?,"What are the metadata attributes described by the Music Meta ontology for artists, compositions, performances, and recordings?"

The ROUGE-L F1 score is **0.26**, which reflects some overlap in the longest common subsequence of words.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the provided statistics, we can infer a few points:

- **High Similarity**: The generated CQ that achieved the highest similarity with the manual CQ focuses on the characteristics and properties of wine. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the properties, characteristics, or classifications of wine, then these could be considered essential CQs that are missing.

- **Diversity of Topics**: If the generated CQs cover a broader range of topics related to wine (e.g., tasting notes, food pairings, wine regions, production methods) that are not reflected in the manual list, then those would also be essential CQs that are missing.

- **Specificity and Context**: Questions that delve into specific contexts or scenarios (e.g., ""What factors influence the taste of wine?"" or ""How does the aging process affect wine quality?"") may also be missing if the manual list is more general.

In summary, without the actual content of the manual list, we cannot definitively identify the missing essential CQs. However, it is likely that questions related to the characteristics, properties, and contextual factors of wine are areas where the manual list may be lacking, especially if they are not represented in the generated CQs. A thorough comparison of both lists would be necessary to pinpoint specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.6338218450546265,0.6563596725463867,Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?,What are the characteristics and properties that define a Wine in the ontology?

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.45**, which is the maximum score recorded for all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common terms between the two questions when considering the set of unique words. This suggests that while the questions may be related in topic (both concerning wine), they are phrased quite differently.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.45) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that the generated CQs may cover aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Here are some potential essential CQs that could be considered missing from the manual list based on the generated CQs:

- **Characteristics of Wine**: Questions that delve into the specific attributes of different types of wine, such as flavor profiles, aging processes, and varietals.
- **Wine Classification**: Questions that explore how wines are categorized (e.g., by region, grape variety, or production method).
- **Regulations and Standards**: Questions regarding the legal definitions and standards that wines must meet to be classified under certain categories (e.g., what qualifies a wine to be labeled as ""organic"" or ""vintage"").
- **Cultural Significance**: Questions that address the cultural or historical significance of certain wines or wine regions.
- **Pairing and Serving**: Questions about food pairings with different types of wine or the best practices for serving wine.

The absence of these types of questions in the manual list suggests that the manual may not fully encompass the breadth of inquiry that could be relevant to the ontology of wine. The generated CQs seem to aim for a more comprehensive exploration of the topic, which is not reflected in the manual CQs. 

In summary, while the highest similarity pair indicates some overlap in topic, the overall low similarity scores suggest that the manual list may be lacking in depth and variety of essential questions related to the ontology of wine.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.4524385929107666,0.5769053101539612,Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?,"What are the characteristics and restrictions associated with the class ""Wine"" in the ontology?"

However, it is important to note that this value is relatively low, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity, it is not particularly strong. The Jaccard similarity of 0.06 further emphasizes the limited overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts between the two questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs should cover a wide range of topics relevant to the ontology in question. If the manual list is limited to specific types of questions (e.g., only about specific wine types), it may miss broader inquiries about the ontology's structure, relationships, or properties.

- **Depth of Inquiry**: Essential CQs should probe deeper into the ontology's functionalities, such as:
  - How are different classes related to each other?
  - What properties are associated with specific classes?
  - Are there any constraints or rules governing the relationships between classes?

- **User Intent**: CQs should reflect the potential queries of users who may be interested in the ontology. If the manual list does not include questions that users might commonly ask, it may be lacking in essential coverage.

Given the statistics provided, it appears that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs, as indicated by the low similarity scores. This suggests that the manual list may be missing a variety of essential questions that could enhance the understanding and usability of the ontology.

**Examples of Potential Missing CQs**:
- ""What are the different types of wine classified in the ontology?""
- ""What properties define the class 'Wine'?""
- ""How does the ontology categorize food pairings with wine?""
- ""What are the restrictions on the class 'Wine' in terms of production methods?""

In summary, the manual list may benefit from a broader and deeper set of CQs that encompass various aspects of the ontology, ensuring comprehensive coverage of user inquiries and enhancing the overall utility of the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.3260181248188019,0.5783795118331909,"Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.38** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.10**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is quite low, indicating minimal shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the statistics indicate a low level of similarity (with the highest cosine similarity being 0.38 and no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

While the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions might be missing from the manual list based on the context of the generated CQ:

- **Questions about the properties of wine**: The generated CQ mentions ""characteristics and restrictions,"" which implies that there may be questions focusing on the chemical properties, flavor profiles, or classifications of wine that are not captured in the manual list.
  
- **Questions regarding wine pairings**: While the manual CQ touches on wine pairings (specifically for grilled meat), there may be other essential pairings or contexts (e.g., wine pairings for different cuisines, occasions, or food types) that are not addressed.

- **Questions about wine production**: Essential questions regarding the process of wine production, including fermentation, aging, and regional differences, may also be missing.

- **Questions about wine regulations**: The mention of ""restrictions"" in the generated CQ suggests that there could be questions related to legal regulations, labeling, or quality standards for wine that are not present in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in CQs that explore the broader aspects of wine, including its properties, production methods, and regulatory considerations, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.38139471411705017,0.6476492285728455,What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?,"What are the characteristics and restrictions associated with the class ""Wine"" in the ontology?"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for coverage of key concepts and themes that are relevant to the domain of interest (in this case, likely related to wine and its properties). 

Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Focus on Properties and Restrictions**: The generated CQ about properties and restrictions of wine suggests that there may be a need for questions that delve deeper into the specific attributes of wine, such as flavor profiles, aging processes, and varietal differences. If the manual list lacks questions that explore these aspects, they could be considered essential.

- **Contextual Relevance**: The manual CQ about the appropriateness of wine for dishes indicates a focus on pairing wine with food. If the generated CQs include questions about food pairings, tasting notes, or the impact of wine characteristics on food compatibility, these could be essential questions that are missing from the manual list.

- **Comparative Analysis**: If the generated CQs include questions that compare different types of wines, their production methods, or their geographical origins, and these are not reflected in the manual list, they would also be considered essential.

In summary, to determine the essential CQs missing from the manual list, one would need to conduct a thorough review of the generated CQs, focusing on areas such as:
- Detailed attributes of wine (e.g., acidity, sweetness, tannins)
- Wine production methods and their implications
- Comparative questions about different wine types or regions
- Questions about the impact of wine characteristics on food pairing

Without the actual list of generated CQs, it is difficult to specify which exact questions are missing, but the above themes should guide the identification of essential CQs that may not be present in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.6236349940299988,0.6688443422317505,Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?,What are the properties and restrictions that define a Wine in the ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the characteristics and properties that define a wine in the ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?""

This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.20
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.06

These scores indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.20 suggests that the vectors representing these questions are somewhat aligned, but not closely. The Jaccard similarity of 0.06 indicates that there is very little overlap in the unique terms used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Since the statistics indicate that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it implies that the generated CQs are significantly different from those in the manual list. This could mean that the manual list may lack coverage in certain areas that the generated CQs address.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Characteristics and Properties**: The generated CQ about the characteristics and properties of wine suggests a focus on defining attributes, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
2. **Ontology-Specific Questions**: The mention of ""ontology"" in the generated CQ indicates a potential gap in questions that relate to the structure, relationships, or classifications within a wine ontology.
3. **Comparative or Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs may include comparative questions (e.g., comparing different types of wines or vintages) that are not present in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore the characteristics, properties, and contextual relationships of wines, particularly in relation to an ontology framework. Further analysis of the specific content of both sets of CQs would be necessary to identify exact missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.19619902968406677,0.6375777125358582,What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?,What are the characteristics and properties that define a wine in the ontology?

Both pairs have a cosine similarity of **0.04** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. This indicates that there is very little overlap in terms of the content or structure of the two questions, suggesting that they are largely dissimilar.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQs should ideally cover a range of topics relevant to the ontology or domain in question. If the manual list lacks questions that address key aspects of the ontology, such as its purpose, structure, or specific functionalities, these would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs should encompass various angles of inquiry, such as:
  - Definitions of key terms within the ontology.
  - Relationships between different entities in the ontology.
  - Use cases or applications of the ontology.
  - Versioning and updates, as seen in the generated CQ.

Given the statistics provided, it appears that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs, as indicated by the low similarity scores. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in diversity and coverage of essential topics related to the ontology.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Definitions**: ""What is the definition of the DOREMUS ontology?""
2. **Entity Relationships**: ""How do different entities within the DOREMUS ontology relate to each other?""
3. **Use Cases**: ""What are some practical applications of the DOREMUS ontology in music information retrieval?""
4. **Versioning**: ""What are the major features introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?""
5. **Comparison**: ""How does the DOREMUS ontology compare to other music ontologies?""

These questions would help ensure that the manual list is comprehensive and addresses the key aspects of the ontology, which are crucial for users seeking to understand or utilize it effectively.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.04232097417116165,0.5046729445457458,"On the MLA mailing list, one asked the following question ""A professor at my university asked me today if I could find any music for flute and TWO bassoons – an interesting combo, to be sure""?",What are the key changes and updates made in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 further emphasizes that there are no common elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not represented in the manual list.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, we can only infer that the generated CQs likely include questions that address newer or more specific aspects of the ontology (e.g., updates, new classes, properties, or specific functionalities) that may not be captured in the manual list. 

For example, the generated CQ about ""new classes and properties introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology"" indicates a focus on updates and changes in the ontology, which may not be present in the manual CQs that could be more general or historical in nature (like the Mozart example).

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would include:
- Questions about recent updates or changes in the ontology.
- Specific inquiries into new classes, properties, or functionalities introduced in the ontology.
- Questions that explore the implications or applications of these updates.

To provide a more precise identification of missing CQs, a direct comparison of the content of both sets of CQs would be necessary.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.02451327070593834,0.627331018447876,Which works have been composed by Mozart?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?

These values indicate that the two questions have very low similarity, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores are quite low (close to 0). This suggests that the content and structure of the questions are significantly different, despite being the highest similarity pair in the dataset.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which the CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores across the board, it can be inferred that the generated CQs may not align well with the manual CQs, indicating potential gaps in coverage.

Here are some possible essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list, based on common themes in ontology and data management:

- **Ontology Versioning**: Questions related to how different versions of the ontology are managed, such as ""What changes were made in the latest version of the ontology?""
- **Class Hierarchies**: Questions that explore the relationships between classes, such as ""What are the parent and child classes of a specific class in the ontology?""
- **Property Usage**: Questions that inquire about the usage of properties, such as ""Which properties are used to describe a specific class in the ontology?""
- **Data Retrieval**: Questions that focus on retrieving specific data points, such as ""How many instances of a specific class exist in the ontology?""
- **Validation and Consistency**: Questions that address the validation of data within the ontology, such as ""How can I validate the consistency of the data in the ontology?""

The absence of these types of questions in the manual list could indicate a lack of comprehensive coverage of the domain's requirements, which may lead to gaps in the ontology's usability and effectiveness. 

In summary, the analysis shows that the generated and manual CQs have very low similarity, and there may be essential questions related to ontology management and data retrieval that are missing from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.04212736338376999,0.554757297039032,Give me all the sonatas for piano and violin whose duration is between 20 and 30 minutes?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The only pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the works written for oboe and orchestra after the 1900?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.12** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.08**. These values represent the highest similarity scores across all pairs analyzed, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low overall.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to compare the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify any that are not represented. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer the following based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity (0.12) and Jaccard similarity (0.08) suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or types of questions that the generated CQs cover.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of **0.00** indicates that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This further suggests that there are likely essential CQs in the generated set that are not represented in the manual list.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQ about the DOREMUS ontology suggests a focus on ontology properties and classes, which may not be covered in the manual list if it primarily focuses on specific works or compositions (as indicated by the oboe and orchestra example). 

In conclusion, without the specific manual list, it is difficult to pinpoint exact missing CQs, but the analysis indicates that there are likely essential questions related to ontology properties, classes, and possibly other areas of musicology or related fields that are not captured in the manual list. A thorough review of both sets would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.118753582239151,0.5843396186828613,Give me the works written for oboe and orchestra after the 1900?,What are the properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the works written for violin, clarinet and piano (strictly)?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.06
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is quite low overall. The cosine similarity of 0.06 suggests that the vector representations of the two questions are very close to orthogonal, indicating minimal overlap in their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity of 0.09 further supports this, showing that there is a small intersection relative to the union of the sets of terms used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which these CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores and the nature of the questions provided, we can infer a few potential areas where essential CQs might be lacking:

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: Given that the generated CQ references the DOREMUS ontology, it is likely that there are specific queries related to the ontology's structure, relationships, and data that are not captured in the manual list. For example:
  - ""What relationships exist between classes in the DOREMUS ontology?""
  - ""How can I retrieve all instances of a specific class in the DOREMUS ontology?""

- **Functional Queries**: Questions that focus on the functionality of the ontology or its application might be missing. For example:
  - ""How can I query for properties associated with a specific class in the DOREMUS ontology?""
  - ""What are the implications of the new properties added in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?""

- **Version-Specific Inquiries**: Since the generated CQ specifies a version, there may be questions related to changes or updates in that version that are not present in the manual list. For example:
  - ""What changes were made to the DOREMUS ontology in version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?""

- **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare different versions or aspects of the ontology might also be missing. For example:
  - ""How does the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 differ from version 0.2.9?""

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in domain-specific, functional, version-specific, and comparative questions that are essential for a comprehensive understanding and utilization of the DOREMUS ontology. Further analysis of the ontology's documentation and user needs could help identify additional essential CQs that should be included.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.061042871326208115,0.5422767996788025,"Give me the works written for violin, clarinet and piano (strictly)?",What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the works of chamber music that involves at least violin, clarinet and piano?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.02
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

Despite being the highest similarity pair, the values are quite low, indicating that the two questions are not closely related in terms of their content or semantic meaning. The cosine similarity of 0.02 suggests that the vector representations of the questions are nearly orthogonal, while the Jaccard similarity of 0.04 indicates minimal overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs may cover specific aspects of the DOREMUS ontology that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, questions related to the structure, relationships, or specific entities within the ontology could be missing.

- **Depth of Inquiry**: The generated CQs may include questions that probe deeper into the ontology's functionality, such as:
  - ""How does the DOREMUS ontology facilitate the representation of musical works?""
  - ""What are the implications of the changes in version 0.2.10 for data interoperability?""

- **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare the DOREMUS ontology with other ontologies or frameworks could also be essential:
  - ""How does the DOREMUS ontology compare to other music ontologies in terms of expressiveness and usability?""

- **User-Centric Questions**: Questions that focus on user needs or applications of the ontology might be missing:
  - ""What are the practical applications of the DOREMUS ontology in music information retrieval?""

- **Technical Specifications**: Questions that address technical aspects, such as implementation or integration with other systems, could also be relevant:
  - ""What are the technical requirements for implementing the DOREMUS ontology in a music database?""

In summary, the manual list may lack questions that cover a broader range of topics related to the DOREMUS ontology, including its applications, comparative analysis, and technical specifications. The generated CQs suggest a need for a more comprehensive approach to ensure that all relevant aspects of the ontology are addressed.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.018482372164726257,0.49896496534347534,"Give me the works of chamber music that involves at least violin, clarinet and piano?",What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the works of chamber music that involves at most violin, clarinet and piano?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.04
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.08

These values indicate that the two questions have very low similarity across the different metrics, suggesting that they are quite different in terms of content and intent. The maximum and average values for cosine similarity across all pairs are also 0.04, indicating that this is the only pair that reached this level of similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and domain of the generated CQs and compare them to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer some general considerations based on the statistics and the nature of the generated CQ.

Given the generated CQ about the DOREMUS ontology, essential CQs that might be missing could include:

- **Ontology Structure and Relationships**: Questions that inquire about the relationships between classes and properties within the ontology, such as ""What are the relationships between classes in the DOREMUS ontology?"" or ""How are properties defined in the DOREMUS ontology?""

- **Versioning and Changes**: Questions that focus on the differences between versions of the ontology, such as ""What changes were made in the DOREMUS ontology from version 0.2.9 to 0.2.10?""

- **Usage and Application**: Questions that explore how the ontology can be applied or used in specific contexts, such as ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be used to describe chamber music works?""

- **Data Retrieval**: Questions that ask for specific data retrieval from the ontology, such as ""What classes in the DOREMUS ontology represent musical works?"" or ""Which properties are used to describe composers in the DOREMUS ontology?""

In summary, while the specific manual list is not available for direct comparison, the generated CQ suggests that there may be gaps in the manual list regarding ontology structure, versioning, application, and data retrieval related to the DOREMUS ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.04281768947839737,0.5200710296630859,"Give me the works of chamber music that involves at most violin, clarinet and piano?",What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key changes made in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the works of chamber music that involves at most violin, clarinet and piano, except from the sonatas for violin and piano and clarinet and piano?""

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are 0.06, which indicates a very low level of similarity. This suggests that the content and intent of the two questions are quite different, despite being the highest among the pairs analyzed.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs may cover specific aspects of the ontology or domain that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about specific functionalities, relationships, or properties of the ontology that are not represented in the manual list, these would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Variability in Question Types**: The manual list may lack diversity in the types of questions posed. For example, if the generated CQs include questions that require different types of responses (e.g., factual, definitional, procedural) and the manual list is predominantly focused on one type, this indicates a gap.

- **Specificity and Detail**: If the generated CQs are more specific or detailed than those in the manual list, they may address nuances or particular scenarios that are important for users of the ontology but are not captured in the manual.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the generated CQs explore different angles or details about the ontology that the manual list does not cover. 

To provide a more concrete analysis, one would need to review the full set of generated CQs and the manual CQs to identify specific topics, themes, or question types that are underrepresented in the manual list. This would involve a qualitative assessment of the content of both sets of questions to pinpoint the missing essential CQs. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of specific aspects of the ontology, diversity in question types, and detail, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the ontology's capabilities and applications.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.05778469145298004,0.45285487174987793,"Give me the works of chamber music that involves at most violin, clarinet and piano, except from the sonatas for violin and piano and clarinet and piano?",What are the key changes made in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key features and changes introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology for describing music?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the melodies written on French texts for average voice between 1870 and 1913?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.32
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.32, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.10 suggests that there is a low overlap in the actual content or terms used in the questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the domain they are addressing. Given that the generated CQ focuses on the features and changes in a specific version of the DOREMUS ontology, it suggests a need for questions that cover:

- **Versioning and Updates**: Questions that inquire about the differences between various versions of the ontology, including what new features or changes were introduced.
- **Ontology Structure and Components**: Questions that explore the structure of the ontology, such as its classes, properties, and relationships, which are crucial for understanding how to use the ontology effectively.
- **Use Cases and Applications**: Questions that address practical applications of the ontology in real-world scenarios, such as how it can be used to describe music or facilitate music information retrieval.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare the DOREMUS ontology with other ontologies in the same domain, which can help users understand its unique features and advantages.

Given the low similarity scores across the board (e.g., average cosine similarity of 0.32, average Jaccard similarity of 0.10), it is likely that the manual list lacks a comprehensive range of questions that cover these essential aspects. 

In summary, the manual list may benefit from including questions that address ontology versioning, structural components, practical applications, and comparative analyses to provide a more complete set of competency questions relevant to the DOREMUS ontology and its use in music description.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.31920257210731506,0.5779294371604919,Give me all the melodies written on French texts for average voice between 1870 and 1913?,What are the key features and changes introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology for describing music?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the new classes and properties introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the slow movements of chamber music that foresee at least one cello?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.04
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

These values indicate that the two questions are quite dissimilar, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarities are very low. The maximum values for cosine and Jaccard similarity across all pairs are also 0.04 and 0.07, respectively, which suggests that this pair represents the highest similarity found in the analysis.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to compare the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify any that are not represented. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of either the generated or manual CQs, we can infer the following based on the low similarity scores:

- **Lack of Overlap**: The average cosine similarity of 0.04 and the maximum cosine similarity of 0.04 indicate that there is minimal overlap between the generated and manual CQs. This suggests that many essential questions that could be relevant to the domain of interest are likely missing from the manual list.
  
- **Potential Missing Topics**: Given the context of the generated CQ regarding the DOREMUS ontology, essential CQs that might be missing could include:
  - Questions about specific classes or properties within the ontology.
  - Queries related to the relationships between different entities in the ontology.
  - Questions about the application or use cases of the ontology in real-world scenarios.
  - Inquiries about the historical development or changes in the ontology over time.

Without the actual lists of generated and manual CQs, it is difficult to pinpoint specific missing questions. However, the low similarity scores strongly suggest that the manual list may not comprehensively cover the range of topics that the generated CQs address, indicating a need for further exploration and inclusion of additional essential questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.04300045594573021,0.5477136373519897,Give me all the slow movements of chamber music that foresee at least one cello?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?

- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the sacred vocal music for choir written in England since 1945?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.05
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.08

These values indicate that the two questions are quite dissimilar, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarities are very low. The maximum values for cosine similarity across all pairs are also 0.05, indicating that no pairs exhibit significant similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and domain of the generated CQs and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the provided statistics, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity (0.05) and Jaccard similarity (0.08) suggest that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the topics or types of questions covered in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that the generated CQs are likely addressing different aspects or topics than those in the manual list.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Without specific examples of the manual CQs, we can hypothesize that essential CQs related to:
  - Specific features or functionalities of the ontology (e.g., ""What are the main features of the DOREMUS ontology?"")
  - Use cases or applications of the ontology (e.g., ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be applied in musicology research?"")
  - Comparisons with other ontologies or standards (e.g., ""How does the DOREMUS ontology compare to other music ontologies?"")
  - Data integration or interoperability questions (e.g., ""What are the interoperability standards used in the DOREMUS ontology?"")

These types of questions may be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the ontology and its applications but may not be represented in the manual list.

In summary, the analysis indicates that there is a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs, suggesting that essential questions related to the ontology's features, applications, and comparisons may be missing from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.04927166923880577,0.5459465384483337,Give me all the sacred vocal music for choir written in England since 1945?,What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the operas of which the composer is also the librettist?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: -0.00
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

Despite being the highest similarity pair, the cosine similarity is notably low (at -0.00), indicating that the semantic similarity between these two questions is minimal. The Jaccard similarity of 0.04 also suggests that there is very little overlap in the terms used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for key topics or themes that are present in the generated CQs but not represented in the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs and the manual CQs is not provided in your query, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Identify Key Themes**: Review the generated CQs for common themes or topics that are not addressed in the manual list. For example, if the generated CQs focus on specific aspects of the ontology (like version changes, relationships between entities, or specific data retrieval tasks) that are not reflected in the manual CQs, those could be considered missing.

- **Check for Coverage**: Ensure that all relevant areas of inquiry related to the ontology or domain are covered. If there are generated CQs that ask about relationships, properties, or specific instances that are not captured in the manual, those should be noted as missing.

- **Evaluate Specificity**: Look for generated CQs that are more specific or detailed than those in the manual. If the manual CQs are too broad or generic, they may miss out on essential details that could be critical for users.

In summary, without the specific content of both sets of CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint exactly which essential CQs are missing. However, the analysis should focus on thematic coverage, specificity, and the overall relevance of the questions to the intended use of the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",-0.002728782594203949,0.5306146740913391,Give me all the operas of which the composer is also the librettist?,What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the musical incipits associated with a specific musical work in the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all works for which there are alternate castings with different interpreters (e.g. keyboard & orch / cello, oboe & orch)?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.40
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.06

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.40, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low overall. The Jaccard similarity is also quite low at 0.06, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique terms or phrases is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Coverage of Topics**: The generated CQs should ideally cover a wide range of topics relevant to the domain of interest (in this case, likely related to music and the DOREMUS ontology).
- **Diversity of Queries**: The generated CQs should include various types of queries, such as those asking for definitions, relationships, examples, and specific data retrieval.

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision (Precision@0.6 = 0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be several essential CQs that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Queries about Relationships**: Questions that explore relationships between different entities in the ontology, such as ""What are the relationships between composers and their works?""
2. **Specific Data Retrieval**: Questions that ask for specific data points, such as ""List all composers who have works in the DOREMUS ontology.""
3. **Comparative Queries**: Questions that compare different works or composers, such as ""How do the works of composer A differ from those of composer B?""
4. **Contextual Queries**: Questions that seek contextual information, such as ""In what historical context was a specific work composed?""

This pair represents the highest similarity across all metrics, indicating that while there is some overlap in the topics addressed (music catalogues and works), the specific focus and phrasing differ significantly.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the domain of the DOREMUS ontology and music cataloguing. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs are exploring different aspects or dimensions of the ontology that may not be captured in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Ontology Versioning and Changes**: Questions that specifically address how changes in the ontology affect data representation or querying. For example:
   - ""How does the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology impact the representation of music works?""
   - ""What changes have been made to the relationships between classes in the DOREMUS ontology?""

2. **Data Retrieval and Querying**: Questions that focus on how to effectively retrieve data using the ontology. For example:
   - ""What queries can be constructed to retrieve works based on specific musical attributes defined in the DOREMUS ontology?""
   - ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be used to find works by a specific composer or genre?""

3. **Interoperability and Integration**: Questions that explore how the DOREMUS ontology interacts with other ontologies or data sources. For example:
   - ""How does the DOREMUS ontology integrate with other music-related ontologies?""
   - ""What are the interoperability standards used in the DOREMUS ontology?""

4. **User Guidance and Best Practices**: Questions that provide guidance on using the ontology effectively. For example:
   - ""What are the best practices for using the DOREMUS ontology in music data cataloguing?""
   - ""What common pitfalls should be avoided when working with the DOREMUS ontology?""

These missing CQs highlight areas of inquiry that are crucial for users of the DOREMUS ontology but may not be adequately represented in the manual list. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness and utility of the manual CQs for users seeking to leverage the ontology effectively.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.2375936210155487,0.564595103263855,Give me all the works for which there are alternative castings with a different number of instruments (e.g. 2 pianos or 4 hands piano)?,What are the key properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology for describing music catalogues?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key features and changes introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me a list of melodies of 20th century about gastronomy?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.19** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. Despite being the highest similarity pair, the values are relatively low, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or semantics.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer some general points based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity (0.19) and Jaccard similarity (0.04) suggest that the generated CQs are not closely related to the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the topics or types of questions covered in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This suggests that there are likely essential CQs that are not represented in the manual list, as none of the generated questions are deemed sufficiently similar to any in the manual.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Given the nature of the generated CQ about the DOREMUS ontology, it is likely that essential CQs related to ontology features, updates, or specific functionalities of the DOREMUS ontology are missing from the manual list. Additionally, if the manual list lacks questions about versioning, changes in ontology standards, or specific applications of the ontology, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

In summary, while we cannot specify the exact missing CQs without the manual list, the analysis indicates that there are likely significant gaps in the manual CQs, particularly regarding ontology-specific inquiries and updates. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs in detail to identify specific topics that are not covered in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.19247180223464966,0.5462474226951599,Give me a list of melodies of 20th century about gastronomy?,What are the key features and changes introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

These values indicate that the two questions are quite dissimilar, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarities are very low. The maximum values for cosine similarity across all pairs are also 0.03, indicating that no pairs exhibit significant similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your request, I can suggest a general approach to identify missing essential CQs:

- **Identify Key Themes**: Review the generated CQs to identify key themes or topics that are not represented in the manual list. This could include specific aspects of the ontology, such as versioning, changes, or specific use cases that are not covered.

- **Check for Coverage**: Compare the generated CQs against the manual list to see if there are any questions that address different facets of the ontology or its applications that are not included in the manual.

- **Consider User Needs**: Think about the potential users of the ontology and what questions they might have that are not addressed in the manual list. This could include questions about implementation, integration with other systems, or specific queries about data types and structures.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that there are several essential CQs that are missing from the manual list. A thorough review of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint these gaps accurately. 

In summary, the analysis indicates a significant lack of overlap between the generated and manual CQs, suggesting that the manual list may not fully capture the range of questions that users might have regarding the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.03209782764315605,0.5796641707420349,Give me a list of works of chamber music composed in the 19th century by Scandinavian composers?,What are the key changes in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compared to previous versions?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.44** and the maximum of **0.44** suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or aspects covered by the generated CQs.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of **0.00** for matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicates that none of the generated CQs closely match any of the manual CQs at a higher threshold of similarity. This further suggests that there are likely essential questions in the generated set that are not represented in the manual set.

- **Diversity of Topics**: Given the nature of the generated CQ regarding ""key properties and classes"" in the DOREMUS ontology, it is likely that other essential questions related to the ontology's structure, relationships, or specific use cases may be missing from the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary. This review would involve looking for questions that cover different aspects of the ontology, such as:

- Relationships between entities (e.g., ""What relationships exist between composers and their works in the DOREMUS ontology?"")
- Specific attributes of entities (e.g., ""What attributes are used to describe a performer in the DOREMUS ontology?"")
- Queries about the ontology's usage or applications (e.g., ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be used to analyze musical works?"")

In summary, while we cannot pinpoint exact missing CQs without the full list of generated questions, the analysis suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, particularly regarding the ontology's properties, relationships, and applications.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.4384775757789612,0.583220899105072,Give me the list of the works of which at least one of the dedicatees is also a performer of the work?,What are the key properties and classes used to describe a musical work in the DOREMUS ontology?

The ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.19 indicates some level of similarity in the longest common subsequence, but overall, the similarities are still quite low.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the domain of interest (in this case, the DOREMUS ontology and musical works). 

Given the generated CQ about the changes in the DOREMUS ontology, it suggests a focus on:

- **Ontology Versioning**: Questions regarding how different versions of the ontology affect data representation.
- **Impact on Musical Works**: Questions that explore how changes in the ontology influence the categorization or representation of musical works.

Based on this, some essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list might include:

1. **Ontology Change Impact**: ""How do changes in the DOREMUS ontology affect the classification of musical genres?""
2. **Version Comparison**: ""What are the differences between version 0.2.10 and previous versions of the DOREMUS ontology?""
3. **Data Representation**: ""How does the DOREMUS ontology represent different types of musical works, and how has this changed over time?""
4. **Use Cases**: ""What are the practical applications of the DOREMUS ontology in music information retrieval?""
5. **User Feedback**: ""What feedback have users provided regarding the usability of the DOREMUS ontology in representing musical works?""

These questions would help to cover aspects of ontology management, user interaction, and the implications of changes in the ontology, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the DOREMUS ontology and its application in the field of music. 

In summary, while the generated and manual CQs show some overlap, there are significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled with questions focusing on ontology changes, their implications, and user perspectives.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.30410176515579224,0.5926566123962402,Give me the list of works composed by Mozart in the last 5 years of his life?,"What are the key changes made in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology, and how do they impact the representation of musical works?"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or topics that are not represented in the manual list. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Ontology-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ about ""newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology"" indicates a focus on ontology updates, which may not be present in the manual list. This type of question is crucial for users interested in the latest developments in ontology structures.

2. **Version-Specific Queries**: The mention of ""version 0.2.10"" in the generated CQ suggests that there may be a need for questions that address specific versions of ontologies or datasets, which could be essential for users needing to work with particular versions.

3. **Property and Class Relationships**: Questions that explore the relationships between different classes and properties within the ontology could be missing. For example, queries like ""What are the relationships between classes in the DOREMUS ontology?"" would be valuable.

4. **Data Retrieval Queries**: The manual CQ about works of J.S. Bach focuses on retrieving specific data points. There may be a lack of similar queries in the manual list that ask for data retrieval from other datasets or ontologies, such as ""What are the properties associated with works in the DOREMUS ontology?""

5. **Comparative Queries**: Questions that compare different versions of an ontology or different ontologies could also be missing. For instance, ""How does the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10 compare to version 0.2.9?"" would be an essential question for users tracking changes.

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the works for piano connected to other musical works?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.09
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.09 suggests that the vector representations of these questions are not closely aligned, and the Jaccard similarity of 0.04 indicates that there is minimal overlap in the sets of words used in the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which these CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest being 0.09), it can be inferred that the generated CQs may not align well with the manual CQs.

Given the statistics:
- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.09, indicating that the generated CQs are not closely related to the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs.

This suggests that there may be a significant number of essential CQs that are not represented in the manual list. 

To identify specific missing CQs, one would typically need to:
- Review the domain requirements and objectives to identify key areas of inquiry that should be addressed.
- Compare the themes and topics of the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify gaps.

Since the provided data does not include a comprehensive list of either the generated or manual CQs, it is not possible to specify exact missing questions. However, it is clear that the generated CQs do not effectively cover the same ground as the manual CQs, indicating a potential need for further development and refinement of the generated questions to ensure they encompass all essential areas of inquiry relevant to the ontology in question. 

In summary, the analysis suggests that there are likely several essential CQs missing from the manual list, particularly those that align more closely with the specific needs and contexts of the ontology being addressed. Further investigation into the domain's requirements would be necessary to identify these gaps accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.09374111890792847,0.5127397179603577,Give me all the works for piano connected to other musical works?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key changes and updates made in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all works for piano based on works of Schubert?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.09
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the cosine similarity is the highest among all pairs, it is still quite low, suggesting that the two questions are not closely related in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 further emphasizes that there are no common elements in the sets of words used in these questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and intent of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer some general points based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.09 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.00 indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This suggests that there may be significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or types of questions that the generated CQs cover.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Given the generated CQ about the DOREMUS ontology, it seems that the manual list may be lacking questions related to ontology updates, changes, or specific details about the DOREMUS ontology itself. If the manual list primarily focuses on works of composers (like Schubert), it may miss out on technical or metadata-related questions that are crucial for understanding the ontology's evolution.

- **Diversity of Questions**: The generated CQs may also include a broader range of topics or question types that are not represented in the manual list. For example, questions about the implications of changes in the ontology, comparisons with previous versions, or specific applications of the ontology in different contexts might be missing.

In summary, while we cannot specify exact missing CQs without the manual list, it is clear that the generated CQs suggest a need for more diverse and technically focused questions, particularly regarding ontology updates and their implications, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.08537819236516953,0.5421740412712097,Give me all works for piano based on works of Schubert?,What are the key changes and updates made in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.08
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

These scores are notably low, indicating that while this pair is the most similar among all pairs, the overall similarity between the generated and manual CQs is quite weak.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your request, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Identify Themes and Topics**: Review the generated CQs to identify key themes, topics, or concepts that are not represented in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about specific functionalities, relationships, or attributes of the ontology that are not covered in the manual CQs, those would be considered missing.

- **Check for Coverage**: Ensure that all aspects of the ontology are addressed. If the generated CQs include inquiries about classes, properties, relationships, or specific use cases that are not reflected in the manual CQs, these should be noted as missing.

- **Consider User Needs**: Reflect on the potential needs of users querying the ontology. If the generated CQs address user scenarios or questions that are common in the domain but are absent from the manual list, these should be highlighted as essential missing CQs.

In summary, without the specific content of the generated CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint exact missing questions. However, a thorough comparison of themes, coverage, and user needs can help identify essential CQs that should be included in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.07771864533424377,0.5498084425926208,Give me all the works related to an extra-musical artistic field?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which the CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores and the nature of the generated CQs, we can infer a few potential areas where essential CQs might be missing:

- **Version-Specific Inquiries**: The generated CQ about ""new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology"" suggests that there may be a need for questions that focus on versioning, updates, and changes in the ontology. If the manual list does not include questions about version history or specific changes, this could be a significant gap.

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: The manual CQ about ""works related to popular music"" indicates a focus on specific domains. If the generated CQs include questions about other domains (e.g., classical music, genres, or specific artists), and these are not represented in the manual list, then those could be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Functional Queries**: Questions that address the functionality of the ontology, such as how to query for specific data types or relationships, may also be missing. For example, questions like ""How can I retrieve all properties associated with a specific class in the DOREMUS ontology?"" could be essential for users interacting with the ontology.

- **Use Case Scenarios**: If the generated CQs include practical use cases or scenarios for applying the ontology, and these are not reflected in the manual list, they could represent essential missing questions. For instance, ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be used to analyze trends in music consumption?"" could be a valuable addition.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely revolve around versioning, domain-specific inquiries, functional queries, and practical use cases related to the ontology. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific missing questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.07975797355175018,0.5383250117301941,Give me all the works related to popular music?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.06
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is quite low overall. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.06, which suggests that this is the only pair that exhibits the highest similarity in the dataset.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Coverage of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover specific aspects of the domain that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, the generated CQ about ""newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology"" suggests a focus on ontology updates and structure, which may not be represented in the manual list.

- **Diversity of Questions**: The generated CQs might include questions that explore different facets of the domain, such as querying for specific data types, relationships, or functionalities that are not captured in the manual list. 

- **Specificity and Detail**: The generated CQs may provide more detailed or specific inquiries that are essential for comprehensive understanding or usage of the ontology, which might be lacking in the manual list.

Given the statistics provided, it appears that the manual list may not adequately cover the following essential areas:

1. **Ontology Structure and Updates**: Questions related to the structure of the ontology, such as classes, properties, and their relationships, are crucial for users who need to understand the ontology's framework.

2. **Data Retrieval and Relationships**: While the manual list includes some retrieval questions, it may lack questions that explore the relationships between different entities or the context of data retrieval.

3. **Versioning and Changes**: Questions that address the implications of different versions of the ontology, such as changes in classes or properties, are essential for users who need to work with specific versions.

4. **Use Cases and Applications**: CQs that explore practical applications of the ontology in real-world scenarios may also be missing, which could help users understand how to apply the ontology effectively.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating questions that address ontology structure, versioning, relationships, and practical applications to ensure comprehensive coverage of essential topics.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.06118954345583916,0.4971117079257965,Retrieve the works by artists that have been mutually lovers?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual CQs is not provided in your query, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Identify Key Topics**: Review the generated CQs to identify key topics, concepts, or entities that are not represented in the manual CQs. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about specific versions of ontologies, properties, or classes that are not addressed in the manual, these would be considered missing.

- **Assess Coverage**: Evaluate the breadth of topics covered in the manual CQs. If the manual list focuses heavily on certain aspects (e.g., artist names and birth dates) but neglects others (e.g., ontology versions, properties, or relationships), then those neglected areas represent essential CQs that are missing.

- **Consider User Needs**: Think about the potential user needs or queries that might arise in the context of the ontology or domain being addressed. If the generated CQs reflect common user inquiries that are not captured in the manual list, these should be flagged as missing.

In summary, without the specific content of the manual CQs, I cannot provide a definitive list of missing essential CQs. However, the analysis should focus on identifying gaps in topics, concepts, and user needs based on the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.022925913333892822,0.5346134901046753,Give me the name and the birth date of artists that played the oboe?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the domain they are addressing. Given that the generated CQ focuses on specific changes in an ontology version, it suggests a need for questions that address:

- **Versioning and Change Management**: Questions that inquire about the differences between various versions of the ontology, such as ""What are the differences between ontology versions v0.2.9 and v0.2.10 of the DOREMUS music catalogue?""

- **Ontology Structure and Relationships**: Questions that explore the structure of the ontology, such as ""What classes and properties are defined in the DOREMUS music catalogue ontology?""

- **Data Retrieval and Queries**: Questions that focus on retrieving specific data from the ontology, such as ""How can I retrieve all musicians associated with a specific concert in the DOREMUS music catalogue?""

- **Use Cases and Applications**: Questions that address practical applications of the ontology, such as ""How is the DOREMUS music catalogue ontology used in music data management?""

- **Integration with Other Ontologies**: Questions that explore how the DOREMUS ontology interacts with other ontologies, such as ""What are the relationships between the DOREMUS music catalogue ontology and other music-related ontologies?""

The absence of these types of questions in the manual list indicates a potential gap in the coverage of essential competencies related to the ontology and its applications. Addressing these gaps would enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list of CQs, ensuring that it adequately reflects the needs and inquiries relevant to the domain of the DOREMUS music catalogue.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.25976094603538513,0.5813924074172974,Give me the list of musicians of the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra having a chamber music activity in concerts organized by Radio France?,What are the key changes made in the ontology version v0.2.10 of the DOREMUS music catalogue?

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.02
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

These values are notably low, indicating that even the highest similarity pair does not exhibit a strong semantic or lexical overlap. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.02, which suggests that the generated and manual CQs are quite distinct from one another overall.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual CQs is not provided, we can infer the following based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity (0.02) and Jaccard similarity (0.05) indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This suggests that there may be significant gaps in the topics or types of questions being addressed.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that essential questions that could be relevant to the domain or context of the ontology are likely missing from the manual list.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Without the specific manual CQs, we can hypothesize that essential questions related to:
  - The relationships between classes and properties in the ontology.
  - Queries about specific instances or examples of data within the ontology.
  - Questions regarding the versioning and changes in the ontology over time.
  - Queries about the application or use cases of the ontology in real-world scenarios.

In summary, the analysis indicates that there is a significant divergence between the generated and manual CQs, suggesting that the manual list may be lacking in essential questions that cover a broader range of topics relevant to the ontology.

Despite being the highest similarity pair, the values indicate a very low level of similarity overall. The cosine similarity of 0.01 suggests that the vector representations of the two questions are almost orthogonal, indicating minimal overlap in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity of 0.08 also reflects a low degree of shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it appears that the generated CQs do not align well with the manual CQs. The following points can be inferred regarding essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list:

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of the DOREMUS ontology, such as classes and properties. If the manual list does not include questions about ontology structure, updates, or specific elements like classes and properties, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Performance and Interpretation**: The manual CQ about performances and composers suggests a focus on artistic interpretations. If the generated CQs do not address the relationship between composers and their works, or the context of performances, these could also be seen as missing.

- **Versioning and Updates**: The generated CQ specifically mentions a version of the ontology (0.2.10). If the manual list lacks questions about versioning, updates, or changes in the ontology, this could represent a significant gap.

- **Comparative or Analytical Questions**: Questions that compare different versions of the ontology, or analyze the impact of changes, may also be missing. These types of questions are often essential in ontology management and understanding.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis indicates that the pairs with the highest similarity are still very low in terms of semantic overlap. Essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely include those focused on ontology structure, relationships between entities, versioning, and comparative analyses. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQ set.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.011108653619885445,0.5044917464256287,Give me all the performances in which a composer interprets his or her works?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

The cosine similarity of 0.08 suggests that the vector representations of the questions are not closely aligned, and the Jaccard similarity of 0.10 indicates that there is a small overlap in the sets of words used in both questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs may cover specific aspects of the DOREMUS ontology that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, questions about the relationships between classes, specific properties of the ontology, or queries about the ontology's structure and updates may be underrepresented.

- **Depth of Inquiry**: The generated CQs might include more detailed or technical inquiries that are not present in the manual list. For example, questions that delve into the implications of new classes or properties, or how they relate to existing elements in the ontology, could be missing.

- **User Perspective**: The generated CQs may reflect user needs or scenarios that are not captured in the manual list. For instance, questions that focus on practical applications of the ontology or user interactions with it could be absent.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the manual list does not encompass the full range of potential inquiries that users might have regarding the DOREMUS ontology. 

### Conclusion

In summary, the highest similarity pair between the generated and manual CQs shows a low degree of alignment, indicating that the manual list may lack essential questions that cover various aspects of the DOREMUS ontology. To improve the manual list, it would be beneficial to analyze the generated CQs further and identify specific areas of inquiry that are currently unaddressed. This could enhance the comprehensiveness and utility of the manual list for users seeking information about the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.07894587516784668,0.608151912689209,Give me the list of concerts of the Orchestre National de France in which the conductor is also instrumental soloist (in the same concert)?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the new classes and properties introduced in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the list of concerts given at the Philharmonie de Paris in which the orchestra is directed by the solo violin?""

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are 0.07, which is the maximum value recorded for all pairs. This indicates that while the similarity is technically the highest among the pairs, it is still quite low overall, suggesting that the generated and manual questions are not closely aligned in terms of content or intent.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and domain of the CQs. However, based on the low similarity scores across the board, it can be inferred that the generated CQs may not align well with the manual CQs, indicating potential gaps in the manual list.

Given the statistics:
- The average cosine similarity is 0.07, and the maximum is also 0.07, suggesting that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a strong enough similarity to be considered relevant or essential compared to the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Domain-Specific Questions**: If the manual list is focused on specific aspects of the DOREMUS ontology, such as its applications, relationships, or specific data points, then generated CQs that explore these areas may be missing.
- **Contextual Questions**: Questions that address the context in which the ontology is used, such as its impact on musicology or data interoperability, may also be absent.
- **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare different versions of the ontology or ask about changes over time could be essential but are not represented in the manual list.

In summary, while specific missing CQs cannot be identified without further context, it is clear that the generated CQs do not align well with the manual list, suggesting that essential questions related to the ontology's application, context, and comparative aspects may be lacking. Further analysis of the domain and intended use of the ontology would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.06709447503089905,0.5652474164962769,Give me the list of concerts given at the Philharmonie de Paris in which the orchestra is directed by the solo violin?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the list of concerts performed at the Abbaye aux Dames de Saintes outside the festival period of Saintes?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.08
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

These values indicate that the two questions share very little semantic similarity, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarities are quite low. The maximum and average values for these metrics across all pairs are also the same, suggesting that this is the only notable pair in terms of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which the CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores and the nature of the questions provided, we can infer a few potential areas where essential CQs might be lacking:

- **Versioning and Change Tracking**: The generated CQ about ""new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology"" suggests a focus on version control and updates. If the manual list does not include questions related to versioning, updates, or changes in the ontology, this could be a significant gap.

- **Event and Performance Queries**: The manual CQ about concerts indicates a focus on events. If there are no questions related to other types of events, performances, or specific activities within the ontology, this could also represent a missing area.

- **Relationships and Interactions**: Essential CQs might also include questions about relationships between different entities within the ontology, such as ""What are the relationships between classes in the DOREMUS ontology?"" or ""How do properties interact with classes?""

- **Data Retrieval and Querying**: Questions that focus on how to retrieve specific data or perform queries on the ontology could be missing. For example, ""How can I query for all properties associated with a specific class in the DOREMUS ontology?""

- **Ontology Structure and Design**: Questions that explore the overall structure, design principles, or rationale behind the ontology could also be essential. For instance, ""What design principles were followed in the creation of the DOREMUS ontology?""

In summary, the analysis suggests that the manual list may be lacking in questions related to versioning, event queries, relationships, data retrieval, and ontology structure. Identifying these gaps can help in refining the manual list to ensure comprehensive coverage of the domain's requirements.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.0767662525177002,0.5617484450340271,Give me the list of concerts performed at the Abbaye aux Dames de Saintes outside the festival period of Saintes?,What are the new classes and properties introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the list of the works that were created where they were composed?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.16
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.08

This indicates that while there is some degree of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.16 suggests that the questions share some common terms or concepts, but they are not closely aligned in terms of their overall meaning or intent. The Jaccard similarity of 0.08 further emphasizes that the overlap in unique terms is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.16) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it can be inferred that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list. 

To identify essential CQs that might be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following:

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQs may include specific inquiries about the ontology (e.g., properties, classes, updates) that are not present in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions that address the structure, updates, or specific elements of the DOREMUS ontology, these would be essential CQs that are missing.

- **Comparative or Historical Questions**: The generated CQ about the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology suggests a need for questions that compare different versions or ask about historical changes. If the manual list does not include such comparative questions, they would be considered essential.

- **Functional or Application-Based Questions**: Questions that explore how the ontology is applied or used in practice (e.g., ""How can the DOREMUS ontology be utilized in music information retrieval?"") may also be missing. These types of questions are crucial for understanding the practical implications of the ontology.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific inquiries about the ontology's structure, updates, comparative aspects, and practical applications, which are not captured in the existing manual questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.1590363085269928,0.5617748498916626,Give me the list of the works that were created where they were composed?,What are the properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me all the works for which the title of the Performed Expression is different from the title of the work?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.11
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, as evidenced by the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs being only 0.11. This suggests that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for their coverage of key concepts and topics that are not represented in the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that the manual CQs do not address.

However, without the actual content of the manual CQs, it is challenging to specify which essential CQs are missing. Generally, one would look for:

- **Coverage of New Concepts**: If the generated CQs introduce new classes, properties, or relationships that are relevant to the ontology but are not mentioned in the manual CQs, these would be considered essential missing questions.
- **Diversity of Queries**: If the generated CQs explore different types of queries (e.g., queries about relationships, attributes, or specific instances) that are not represented in the manual list, these would also be essential.
- **Specificity and Context**: If the generated CQs provide specific contexts or scenarios that are relevant to the ontology but are absent in the manual CQs, these should be noted as missing.

To accurately identify the missing essential CQs, a detailed comparison of the content and themes of both sets of questions would be necessary. This would involve examining the generated CQs for unique topics or angles that are not captured in the manual list. 

In summary, while the specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the manual list, the analysis suggests that the generated CQs likely cover different or additional aspects of the ontology that are not represented in the manual CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.10583531111478806,0.5008217692375183,Give me all the works for which the title of the Performed Expression is different from the title of the work?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.27
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07
- **BERTScore-F1**: 0.57
- **BLEU**: 0.01
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.19

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.27, which indicates a relatively low level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity is also low at 0.07, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique words or phrases is minimal. However, the BERTScore-F1 of 0.57 indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity when considering contextual embeddings, which may reflect some shared concepts or themes despite the low cosine and Jaccard scores.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Versioning and Modifications**: The generated CQ about the ""different versions and modifications made to the DOREMUS ontology"" indicates a focus on the evolution of the ontology, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This aspect is crucial for understanding how the ontology has changed over time and how those changes impact its usage.

2. **Interpretation Contexts**: The generated CQ regarding interpretations of works in different contexts (e.g., ""Give me all the works interpreted on at least one mop different from the casting of the work?"") suggests a need for questions that explore the various contexts or frameworks through which works are interpreted. This could include questions about different methodologies, theoretical frameworks, or cultural contexts that influence interpretation.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: There may be a lack of questions that ask for comparisons between different ontologies or frameworks, which could be essential for users looking to understand the relationships and distinctions between various systems.

4. **User Interaction and Feedback**: Questions that address how users interact with the ontology or how feedback is incorporated into its development may also be missing. This could include inquiries about user experiences, challenges faced, or suggestions for improvement.

5. **Use Cases and Applications**: Essential CQs that explore specific use cases or applications of the DOREMUS ontology in real-world scenarios may also be absent. This could help users understand the practical implications and benefits of using the ontology.

In summary, while the manual list may cover certain aspects of the domain, the generated CQs suggest that there are additional dimensions, particularly regarding ontology evolution, interpretation contexts, comparative analysis, user interaction, and practical applications, that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.2742036283016205,0.5671829581260681,Give me all the works interpreted on at least one mop different from the casting of the work?,What are the different versions and modifications made to the DOREMUS ontology over time?

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the highest similarity among all pairs analyzed, but it is important to note that the similarity scores are quite low overall, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of content or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for the following:

- **Coverage of Key Topics**: Essential CQs should cover the main topics and functionalities that the ontology or system is expected to address. If the generated CQs include questions about aspects of the ontology that are not represented in the manual list, those would be considered missing.

- **Diversity of Queries**: The generated CQs may include a variety of question types (e.g., factual, comparative, procedural) that are not present in the manual list. If the manual list is limited in scope or type, it may miss out on important queries that users might have.

- **Specificity and Detail**: Generated CQs that delve into specific details about the ontology (like versioning, specific properties, or classes) may not be reflected in the manual list, which could indicate a gap in the manual's comprehensiveness.

Given the statistics provided, it appears that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs, as indicated by the low similarity scores. Therefore, a thorough review of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific questions that are essential but missing from the manual list. 

In summary, without the actual content of the manual CQs and a comprehensive list of generated CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint exact missing questions. However, the analysis suggests that there is a significant gap in similarity, indicating that the manual list may not fully encompass the range of inquiries that users might have regarding the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.06003110110759735,0.553270161151886,Give me the artists that have been recorded more than 10 times by Radio France?,What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.08
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

These values indicate that the two questions share very little semantic similarity, as both the cosine and Jaccard similarities are quite low. The maximum values for cosine and Jaccard similarity across all pairs are also 0.08 and 0.07, respectively, suggesting that this pair represents the best match in terms of similarity metrics.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and content of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs and the manual CQs is not provided in detail, we can infer some general points based on the statistics and the nature of the analysis:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.08 and the maximum of 0.08 indicate that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This suggests that the generated CQs may be addressing different aspects or topics than those covered in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of 0.00 indicates that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This further emphasizes that there are likely significant gaps in the topics or questions being addressed.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that essential CQs related to key aspects of the ontology, specific functionalities, or user needs that are not captured in the manual list are missing. For example, questions about:
  - Specific use cases of the DOREMUS ontology.
  - Queries related to the relationships between different entities in the ontology.
  - Questions about the implications of the updates made in the ontology version.
  - User-centric questions that might address common queries or needs of the target audience.

In conclusion, while we cannot specify the exact missing CQs without additional context, it is clear that the generated CQs are not adequately covering the essential topics that should be present in the manual list, leading to a significant gap in the overall competency question set. Further analysis of the content of both sets would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.07530675828456879,0.5783466100692749,Give me the list of the choristers of the Collegium Vocale who participated in at least three radio recordings of the choir in 2012?,What are the key changes and updates made in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.12
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

These metrics indicate that the two questions share some degree of similarity, but the values are quite low, suggesting that the content and focus of the questions are largely different. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.12, indicating that this is the only pair that stands out in terms of similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and intent of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer some general considerations based on the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the manual list lacks CQs that cover the following areas:

- **Ontology-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ about the DOREMUS ontology suggests a need for questions that explore the structure, properties, and changes in ontologies related to music. If the manual list does not include questions about ontology updates, properties, or classifications, these would be essential missing CQs.

- **Temporal Queries**: The generated CQ references a specific version of an ontology, indicating a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that address changes over time or specific historical data related to music catalogues.

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ focuses on music catalogues, which may imply that the manual list is missing questions that pertain to specific aspects of music, such as genres, artists, or recording statistics.

- **Comparative or Analytical Questions**: The generated CQ asks for comparisons of properties and classes, suggesting that the manual list may lack questions that require analysis or comparison of different entities or attributes within the music domain.

In summary, without the specific content of the manual list, we can conclude that essential CQs likely missing include those that address ontology changes, temporal aspects, domain-specific inquiries, and comparative analyses related to music catalogues.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.12298287451267242,0.5990435481071472,Give me the name of the vocal soloist most recorded by Radio France in 2014?,What are the key properties and classes introduced or removed in the latest version of the DOREMUS ontology for describing music catalogues?

- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the list of all the concerts recorded by Radio France at the Cité de la Musique between 1995 and 2014?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.09
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is quite low overall. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also 0.09, which suggests that this is the only pair that stands out in terms of similarity, albeit still at a low level.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the context and requirements of the domain for which the CQs are being generated. However, based on the low similarity scores and the nature of the provided pairs, we can infer a few potential areas where essential CQs might be lacking:

- **Domain-Specific Queries**: If the generated CQs focus on specific features or updates of the DOREMUS ontology, the manual list may be missing questions that address the ontology's structure, relationships, or specific use cases in music data management.

- **Temporal Queries**: The manual CQ provided is focused on a specific time frame (1995-2014). There may be other essential temporal queries that are relevant, such as asking about concerts before or after this period, or queries that focus on trends over time.

- **Comparative Queries**: There may be a lack of questions that compare different versions of the ontology or different datasets, which could be crucial for users looking to understand changes or improvements.

- **User-Centric Queries**: Questions that focus on user needs, such as ""How can I access the DOREMUS ontology?"" or ""What tools are available for querying the DOREMUS ontology?"" might be missing.

- **Integration Queries**: Queries that explore how the DOREMUS ontology integrates with other ontologies or datasets could also be essential but are not represented in the manual list.

In summary, while the specific missing CQs cannot be definitively identified without additional context, the analysis suggests that the manual list may lack depth in domain-specific, temporal, comparative, user-centric, and integration-focused questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.08614156395196915,0.5757454037666321,Give me the list of all the concerts recorded by Radio France at the Cité de la Musique between 1995 and 2014?,What are the key features and modifications introduced in version 0.2.10 of the DOREMUS ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is as follows:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the newly created classes and properties in the DOREMUS ontology version 0.2.10?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Give me the list of concerts recorded by Radio France at the auditorium of the Cité de la Musique in which were used one or several French harpsichords of the 17th century belonging to the Musée de la Musique?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.03
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

These values indicate that while this pair has the highest similarity among all pairs, the similarity is still very low, suggesting that the generated and manual CQs are quite different in terms of content and structure.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your request, I can only provide a general approach to identifying missing CQs:

- **Identify Key Topics**: Review the generated CQs for key topics or themes that are not represented in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs focus on specific aspects of the DOREMUS ontology, such as classes, properties, or specific versions, and these topics are absent in the manual list, they would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Assess Coverage**: Evaluate the breadth of topics covered in the manual CQs. If the manual list primarily addresses concerts and specific events, but lacks questions about ontology structures, relationships, or metadata, then those generated CQs focusing on ontology aspects would be essential.

- **Consider User Needs**: Think about the potential users of these CQs. If there are common queries or needs that are not addressed in the manual list but are present in the generated CQs, those should be flagged as essential missing CQs.

The Jaccard similarity of 0.04 further emphasizes the limited overlap in the actual content of the questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and focus of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Anomalies and Detection**: The generated CQ about detecting anomalies in IT networks suggests a focus on security and operational integrity, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This indicates a potential gap in the manual CQs regarding the detection and management of anomalies in IT service management.

2. **Ontology Utilization**: The mention of ""defined ontology for IT service management"" in the generated CQ implies a need for questions that explore how ontologies can be applied in IT service management contexts. This could include questions about the role of ontologies in improving service delivery, enhancing decision-making, or facilitating knowledge sharing.

3. **Asset Management and Relationships**: While the manual CQ mentions shared assets, there may be a lack of questions that explore the relationships between different assets, their dependencies, and how these relationships impact service management. Questions could include:
   - ""How do asset dependencies affect service delivery in IT management?""
   - ""What role do shared assets play in the overall IT service management strategy?""

4. **Performance Metrics and Evaluation**: There may be a need for questions that focus on performance metrics, evaluation of IT services, and how these metrics can be derived from the ontology. For example:
   - ""What performance metrics can be derived from the defined ontology for IT service management?""

5. **Integration with Other Systems**: Questions that explore how the defined ontology integrates with other systems or frameworks in IT service management could also be missing. For instance:
   - ""How can the defined ontology be integrated with existing IT service management tools?""

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list may lack CQs that address specific aspects of anomaly detection, ontology application, asset relationships, performance evaluation, and system integration within the context of IT service management. These areas could be critical for a comprehensive understanding of the domain and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.1326378434896469,0.6738550066947937,What assets are shared by a given asset chain?,What anomalies can be detected within IT networks using the defined ontology for IT service management?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and domain of the generated CQs and compare them against the manual list. However, since the manual list is not provided in your query, I can suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Domain Coverage**: Review the generated CQs to identify topics or areas that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs focus on specific functionalities of the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology, such as anomaly detection, data integration, or sensor interoperability, and these topics are absent in the manual list, they should be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Specificity and Detail**: Examine the level of detail in the generated CQs. If the generated CQs include specific scenarios or use cases that are not reflected in the manual list, these should be added. For example, if the generated CQs ask about specific types of anomalies or specific contexts in which the SSN Ontology is applied, these would be essential to include.

- **Stakeholder Needs**: Consider the needs of the stakeholders or users of the ontology. If the generated CQs address specific user queries or requirements that are not captured in the manual list, these should be included as they reflect the practical application of the ontology.

- **Comparative Analysis**: If possible, conduct a comparative analysis of the generated CQs against the manual list to identify gaps. This could involve looking for unique terms, concepts, or themes present in the generated CQs that are not represented in the manual list.

In summary, without the manual list of CQs, I cannot specify which essential CQs are missing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.04) and the lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Context**: The generated CQ about sensory experiences in the context of cultural heritage odours suggests a focus on the broader implications of sensory stimuli, which may not be captured in the manual list. This could indicate a gap in exploring how cultural contexts influence sensory perception.

2. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes specific sensory stimuli, which may not be addressed in the manual questions. This could include inquiries about particular types of odours or sensory experiences that are significant in cultural heritage contexts.

3. **Temporal Aspects of Sensory Perception**: The manual CQ mentions a specific time of day, which may limit the exploration of sensory experiences to a temporal context. The generated CQ does not specify time, suggesting a broader inquiry that could include various times and settings, which may be essential for a comprehensive understanding of sensory experiences.

4. **Cultural Heritage Focus**: The generated CQ explicitly mentions cultural heritage, which may not be a focus in the manual list. This aspect is crucial for understanding how cultural factors shape sensory experiences and could be a significant area of inquiry that is missing.

In summary, the manual list may lack questions that explore the broader context of sensory experiences, the specificity of sensory stimuli, and the cultural heritage aspect, which are highlighted in the generated CQs. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list of CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.5603382587432861,0.6160342693328857,"Which smells were perceived during [recurrent part of day, e.g. morning]?",What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours?

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity
The only pair provided with a similarity score is:
- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odour experiences?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Was [smell 1, e.g. muck] perceived as more [adjective, e.g. disgusting] than [smell 2, e.g. smog]?""
  
This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.40**, which is the maximum similarity score across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common terms between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share specific vocabulary or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List
To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Average cosine similarity** of **0.40** indicates that there is some level of similarity between the generated and manual questions, but it is relatively low, suggesting that the generated questions may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic.
- **Average Jaccard similarity** of **0.00** indicates that there are no overlapping terms in the questions, which may imply that the generated questions are exploring different angles or concepts that are not captured in the manual list.
- **Precision@0.6** of **0.00** indicates that none of the generated questions have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual questions, suggesting that there are significant gaps in the manual list.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing essential CQs that address the following aspects:

- **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQ about identifying sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts suggests a focus on the broader implications of sensory experiences, which may not be captured in the more specific manual question about comparing two smells.
  
- **Exploratory Questions**: The generated CQ implies a need for exploratory questions that delve into the nature of sensory experiences, their identification, and their significance in cultural heritage, which may not be present in the manual list.

- **Comparative and Qualitative Aspects**: The manual question focuses on a comparative analysis of two specific smells, while the generated question suggests a qualitative exploration of sensory stimuli in a broader context. This indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding qualitative assessments of sensory experiences.

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.39 among all pairs analyzed. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 indicates that there are no common words between the two questions, suggesting that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share lexical overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Processing**: Questions that delve into how sensory stimuli are processed in the brain, which could include inquiries about the neurological pathways involved in sensory perception.
2. **Emotional Associations**: CQs that explore the relationship between specific sensory stimuli (like smells) and emotional responses, particularly in the context of memory recall.
3. **Cultural Influences**: Questions that consider how different cultures perceive and react to sensory stimuli, which could provide a broader understanding of sensory experiences.
4. **Developmental Aspects**: CQs that focus on how sensory perception develops over time, especially in children, and how this relates to memory formation.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare different types of sensory stimuli (e.g., visual vs. olfactory) in terms of their effectiveness in triggering memories.

Given the average cosine similarity of 0.39 and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it is evident that the generated CQs may introduce new dimensions or perspectives that are not captured in the manual list. Therefore, a thorough review of the generated CQs could reveal additional essential questions that would enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.3857786953449249,0.49853092432022095,Which kind of smell is more likely to trigger [childhood] memories?,How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific stimulus generation event and determine the material substantial that served as its source or carrier?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.48
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.48, indicating that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are still quite distinct in terms of their specific focus and phrasing. The Jaccard similarity is notably low (0.03), suggesting that the overlap in terms of shared terms or tokens is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and focus of the generated CQs compared to the manual ones. Given the statistics and the nature of the generated CQ, we can infer several potential areas that might be underrepresented in the manual list:

1. **Focus on Sensory Experience**: The generated CQ emphasizes the identification of sensory stimuli related to cultural heritage, particularly odours. If the manual list lacks questions that explore sensory experiences or the impact of materials on sensory perception, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Temporal Context**: The generated CQ mentions a specific context (""cultural heritage"") but does not specify a temporal aspect. If the manual list does not include questions that address how sensory experiences or materials have changed over time, this could be another missing area.

3. **Material Specificity**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific material,"" suggesting a need for questions that delve into the relationship between particular materials and their sensory properties. If the manual list lacks questions that connect specific materials to sensory experiences or cultural significance, this could be an essential omission.

4. **Quantitative Analysis of Sensory Data**: The manual CQ includes a quantitative aspect (e.g., ""more than [threshold, e.g 100] occurrences""), which suggests a focus on data-driven analysis. If the generated CQs include questions that require quantitative assessments of sensory stimuli or their occurrences, and the manual list does not, this could indicate a missing dimension.

5. **Cultural Heritage Context**: The generated CQ explicitly mentions ""cultural heritage,"" which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. Questions that explore the intersection of sensory experiences and cultural heritage could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely revolve around sensory experiences, temporal changes, material specificity, quantitative analysis, and cultural heritage contexts. Addressing these areas could enhance the completeness and relevance of the manual list of CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.47578662633895874,0.5197782516479492,"Which smells with more than [threshold, e.g 100] occurrences in [time, 18th century] did disappear afterwards?",How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The only pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the material substantial that generated a sensory stimulus associated with a specific sensory experience in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which professions are more present in smelling experience descriptions?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.51
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

This pair has the highest cosine similarity score of 0.51, which indicates a moderate level of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.07 suggests that there is a very low overlap in the actual content or terms used in the two questions. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be related conceptually, they differ significantly in their wording and specific focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Precision@0.6**: 0.00, indicating that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher.
- **Matches with cosine ≥ 0.6**: 0, meaning that none of the generated CQs closely align with the manual CQs based on the cosine similarity metric.

Given that the maximum cosine similarity observed is 0.51, it suggests that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs. This could imply that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or concepts addressed by the generated CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience and Cultural Heritage**: The generated CQ focuses on identifying materials related to sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list does not include questions about sensory experiences, cultural heritage, or the relationship between materials and sensory perception, these could be considered essential missing CQs.
  
2. **Professions Related to Sensory Experiences**: The manual CQ mentions professions in the context of smelling experiences. If there are generated CQs that explore other professions or roles related to sensory experiences (e.g., artists, historians, or sensory analysts), these should be included in the manual list.

3. **Broader Contexts of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ suggests a broader inquiry into sensory stimuli beyond just smelling experiences. If the manual list is limited to specific sensory modalities (like smell), it may miss out on essential questions regarding other senses (sight, touch, taste, etc.) and their relation to cultural heritage.

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list may be lacking in essential CQs that address broader themes of sensory experiences, cultural heritage, and the roles of various professions in these contexts. Expanding the manual list to include these aspects could enhance its comprehensiveness and relevance.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.5110992789268494,0.5864295959472656,Which professions are more present in smelling experience descriptions?,How can we identify the material substantial that generated a sensory stimulus associated with a specific sensory experience in the context of cultural heritage odours?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.18
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while there is some degree of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions (as indicated by the cosine similarity), the Jaccard similarity suggests that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. This could imply that the questions are conceptually related but use different terminology or phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low similarity scores, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Contextual Exploration**: The generated CQ emphasizes the identification of materials that generate sensory stimuli within a cultural heritage context. This suggests a focus on the interplay between materials and sensory experiences, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
  
2. **Sensory Descriptions**: The generated CQ's focus on sensory stimuli implies a need for questions that explore how different sensory experiences (sight, sound, smell, etc.) are described or categorized in cultural heritage contexts. This could include questions about the impact of sensory experiences on cultural understanding or preservation.

3. **Material-Centric Questions**: The generated CQ suggests a need for questions that specifically address the types of materials used in cultural heritage and their sensory implications. This could include inquiries about the properties of materials and how they contribute to sensory experiences.

4. **Interdisciplinary Perspectives**: The mention of ""profession, e.g., medical practitioners"" in the manual CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach. However, the generated CQ may suggest the need for questions that incorporate perspectives from various fields (e.g., anthropology, art history, sensory studies) to enrich the understanding of cultural heritage.

5. **Methodological Approaches**: The generated CQ implies a methodological inquiry into how sensory stimuli are identified and analyzed within cultural heritage. This could lead to questions about the methods used to study sensory experiences in cultural contexts, which may not be present in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely revolve around the exploration of sensory experiences, material properties, interdisciplinary approaches, and methodological inquiries related to cultural heritage. The generated CQs may provide a broader and more nuanced understanding of these topics, which could enhance the overall competency framework.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.18340696394443512,0.5883265733718872,"Which adjectives were used by [profession, e.g. medical practitioners] in describing smells?",How can we identify the material substantial that generates a specific sensory stimulus within a cultural heritage context?

The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is quite low, suggesting that the specific vocabulary used in the two questions differs significantly.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, it appears that the generated CQs have a low similarity to the manual CQs, as indicated by the average cosine similarity of **0.37** and the absence of any matches with a cosine similarity of **0.6 or higher**.

The following points can be inferred regarding the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs seem to cover a broader range of topics, particularly focusing on sensory experiences and material substances in cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list does not include questions that explore these themes, it may lack essential inquiries related to sensory perception and its implications in cultural heritage.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated CQ about ""sensory stimuli"" suggests a focus on the interaction between materials and human perception, which may not be represented in the manual list. If the manual CQs are more general or focused on different aspects of cultural heritage (e.g., historical facts, preservation techniques), then the nuanced exploration of sensory experiences could be a missing element.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQs may also touch on interdisciplinary connections between health, culture, and sensory experiences. If the manual list does not include questions that bridge these areas, it may miss out on essential inquiries that could enrich the understanding of cultural heritage.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to the exploration of sensory experiences, the relationship between material substances and cultural heritage, and interdisciplinary connections that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the themes and topics covered in both sets would be necessary.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.3677974343299866,0.6588948965072632,What was a protective [health] scent in X period?,What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?

- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.18

This pair represents the highest similarity across all evaluated pairs, indicating that while the questions are not identical, they share some conceptual overlap. The generated CQ focuses on sensory experiences in a broader cultural context, while the manual CQ narrows down to specific smells associated with a particular place.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the themes and topics they cover. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.35) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are exploring concepts that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory experiences in cultural heritage suggests a need for questions that explore various senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) in relation to cultural artifacts or environments. This could include questions like:
   - ""How do different cultures interpret visual stimuli in their heritage?""
   - ""What auditory experiences are linked to traditional cultural practices?""

2. **Cultural Context and Sensory Interaction**: The generated CQ implies an interest in how sensory stimuli interact within cultural contexts. Missing questions could include:
   - ""In what ways do sensory experiences influence cultural identity?""
   - ""How do sensory stimuli contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage?""

3. **Specificity in Cultural Heritage**: The manual CQ focuses on a specific sensory experience (smell) related to a particular place. There may be a lack of questions that address other sensory experiences tied to specific cultural sites or events, such as:
   - ""What tactile experiences are associated with traditional crafts in [specific culture]?""
   - ""How do tastes associated with local cuisine reflect cultural heritage?""

4. **Comparative Sensory Analysis**: Questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultures or contexts could also be missing:
   - ""How do sensory experiences differ between urban and rural cultural heritage sites?""

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap between the generated and manual CQs, there are significant gaps in the manual list regarding broader sensory experiences, cultural context, specificity, and comparative analysis. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list of CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.35180455446243286,0.6552088856697083,Which smells are associated with [specific place e.g. the Amsterdam stock exchange]?,What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage?

The Jaccard similarity is also very low at 0.03, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique terms or phrases is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.35 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.03, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their identification in cultural heritage contexts. Manual CQs may lack broader questions that explore the implications of sensory experiences in cultural heritage, such as:
   - ""What role do sensory experiences play in the interpretation of cultural heritage?""
   - ""How do different materials influence sensory perceptions in cultural heritage sites?""

2. **Comparative Questions**: There may be a lack of questions that compare different sensory experiences or materials. For example:
   - ""How do sensory stimuli differ between various cultural heritage materials?""
   - ""What are the comparative sensory impacts of natural versus synthetic materials in heritage contexts?""

3. **Methodological Questions**: Questions that address the methods of identifying or analyzing sensory stimuli may also be missing:
   - ""What methodologies are effective for assessing sensory stimuli in cultural heritage?""

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli generated by material substances suggests a broader inquiry into sensory experiences beyond just smell. This indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that explore other senses (sight, sound, touch, taste) in cultural heritage contexts.

2. **Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ emphasizes the perception of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list. Questions that explore how different cultures interpret or experience sensory stimuli could be essential.

3. **Material Substances**: The focus on specific material substances in the generated CQ suggests that there may be missing questions related to the types of materials and their sensory impacts, which could be relevant in studies of cultural heritage.

4. **Temporal Aspects**: The generated CQ implies a consideration of time and context in sensory perception, which may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that address how sensory experiences change over time or in different historical contexts could be valuable.

- **Sensory Aspects**: The generated CQ about ""sensory stimuli"" indicates a focus on the sensory experiences related to material substances in cultural heritage. If the manual list lacks questions addressing sensory perceptions (e.g., taste, smell, sight) in cultural contexts, this could be a significant gap.
  
- **Material Substances**: The generated CQ emphasizes ""specific material substances,"" which may suggest a need for questions that explore various materials used in cultural heritage (e.g., textiles, ceramics, metals) and their sensory implications. If the manual list does not include questions about the types of materials and their cultural significance, this could be another area of omission.

- **Cultural Heritage Contexts**: The generated CQ's reference to ""cultural heritage contexts"" implies a broader inquiry into how different cultures perceive and interact with sensory stimuli. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the cultural significance of sensory experiences or how they vary across different cultures, this could represent a critical missing element.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to sensory experiences, specific material substances, and the cultural contexts surrounding these elements. Addressing these areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs and improve their alignment with the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.3573552370071411,0.5207641124725342,"Which portrayal of a smell [pomander, tobacco] changed [disappeared/faded/developed] over time?",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?

However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.07 suggests that there is a very low overlap in the actual terms used in both questions, which may indicate that while the questions are conceptually related, they use different language and phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not adequately represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Context**: The generated CQ about identifying sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts indicates a focus on sensory experiences, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This suggests a gap in addressing how sensory experiences (like smell) relate to cultural heritage.

2. **Material-Specific Inquiry**: The generated CQ emphasizes the relationship between specific materials and sensory stimuli. If the manual list lacks questions that explore this relationship, it would be a significant omission.

3. **Cultural Heritage and Odour**: The generated CQ specifically mentions ""cultural heritage odour experiences,"" which may not be represented in the manual list. This indicates a need for questions that explore the intersection of culture and sensory experiences, particularly olfactory ones.

4. **Identification of Sensory Stimuli**: The focus on identifying sensory stimuli suggests a methodological aspect that may be missing from the manual list. Questions that ask how to identify or analyze sensory stimuli could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address the nuances of sensory experiences, particularly in the context of cultural heritage, and the relationship between specific materials and sensory stimuli. This highlights the need for a broader range of questions that encompass these themes to ensure a more comprehensive exploration of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.4760037064552307,0.5837334990501404,"In which text we can find [smell, e.g. citrus]?",How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odour experiences?

Notably, this is the only pair that has been reported with a cosine similarity score above 0.4, indicating that it is the most similar pair between the generated and manual CQs. However, the Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, suggesting that while the semantic content may be somewhat aligned (as indicated by cosine similarity), the actual overlap in terms of shared words or phrases is nonexistent.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.41**, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity overall, but it is not high enough to suggest that the generated CQs are closely aligned with the manual ones.
- The average Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, indicating that there is no overlap in terms of the actual words used in the CQs, which may suggest that the generated CQs are exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list.
- The average BERTScore-F1 of **0.63** indicates that there is some semantic alignment, but it is not reflected in the other similarity measures, suggesting that the generated CQs may be addressing concepts or questions that are not explicitly represented in the manual list.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing CQs that explore the following themes or aspects:

- **Cultural Heritage Context**: The generated CQ mentions ""cultural heritage context,"" which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list.
- **Sensory Stimuli**: The focus on ""sensory stimulus"" in the generated CQ suggests a potential gap in exploring how sensory experiences relate to cultural heritage, which may not be covered in the manual CQs.
- **Material Sources**: The generated CQ's emphasis on identifying ""material substantial"" indicates a potential area of inquiry regarding the origins or materials associated with cultural artifacts or experiences.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that delve into the relationships between sensory experiences, cultural heritage, and the materials that contribute to these experiences.

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.33** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is also very low, indicating that the questions share very few common words.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Some potential essential CQs that could be considered missing from the manual list, based on the generated CQs, might include:

- **CQs related to sensory experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli indicates a focus on how different senses are engaged in cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list lacks questions addressing various sensory experiences (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile), this could be a significant gap.

- **CQs about the perception of cultural heritage**: The generated CQ emphasizes the perception of stimuli in cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list does not include questions that explore how different cultural heritage elements are perceived or interpreted by individuals, this could be another missing area.

- **CQs regarding the impact of specific events**: The generated CQ mentions ""stimulus generation events,"" which suggests an interest in the impact of specific events on sensory experiences. If the manual list does not include questions about the influence of particular events or contexts on sensory perception, this could represent another essential area that is missing.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in questions that explore sensory experiences, perceptions in cultural heritage, and the impact of specific events on these experiences.

The Jaccard similarity is very low, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique terms is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Contextual Coverage**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of sensory experiences related to cultural heritage and odour, which may not be fully represented in the manual list. The manual CQ provided is more general and focuses on the scents described by authors, which may not encompass the broader context of sensory stimuli and their identification.

- **Specificity and Detail**: The generated CQ emphasizes the identification of sensory stimuli in a cultural heritage context, which suggests a need for questions that explore:
  - The relationship between materials and sensory experiences.
  - The role of cultural heritage in shaping sensory perceptions.
  - Specific methodologies for identifying sensory stimuli in various contexts.

- **Potential Missing CQs**:
  - Questions that delve into the methodologies for identifying sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts.
  - Inquiries about the impact of different materials on sensory experiences.
  - Questions that explore the cultural significance of specific scents or sensory experiences in heritage contexts.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that address the identification and analysis of sensory stimuli in relation to cultural heritage, as well as the methodologies used to explore these sensory experiences. This indicates a gap in the manual's coverage of the topic, which could be filled by incorporating more detailed and context-specific questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.49591904878616333,0.5489904284477234,"What scents do [named, country of origin, male/female] authors describe most?",How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odour experiences?

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the generated CQs in detail and compare them against the manual list. However, based on the provided statistics, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of **0.44** and the maximum cosine similarity of **0.44** suggest that while there is some overlap, the generated CQs may not be closely aligned with the manual CQs. This could imply that the generated CQs are exploring different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not captured in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there may be significant gaps in the manual list, as the generated CQs are not closely matching any of the existing manual questions.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Given the context of cultural heritage and sensory experiences, essential CQs that might be missing could include:
  - Questions about the relationship between different sensory stimuli and cultural artifacts.
  - Inquiries into how sensory experiences influence the interpretation of cultural heritage.
  - Questions regarding the methodologies for analyzing sensory stimuli in cultural contexts.
  - CQs that explore the emotional or psychological impact of sensory experiences related to cultural heritage.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in CQs that address broader or more nuanced aspects of sensory experiences in cultural heritage, as indicated by the low similarity scores and the absence of high-precision matches.

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are frequently present in paintings but not in texts?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.51** and a Jaccard similarity score of **0.04**. The cosine similarity indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions, while the Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is quite low, suggesting that while the questions may be related in topic, they differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for content that is not represented in the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average Jaccard similarity of **0.04** and the average BLEU score of **0.01** suggest that there is a significant divergence in the vocabulary and phrasing used in the generated CQs compared to the manual CQs. This indicates that the generated CQs may be addressing different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of **0.00** for matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicates that there are no generated CQs that closely align with the manual CQs in terms of high similarity. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or questions that the generated CQs are exploring.

- **Content Analysis**: To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to see what themes, topics, or specific inquiries they present that are not reflected in the manual list. For instance, the generated CQ about identifying sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage may suggest a focus on sensory experiences and their documentation, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual CQs.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be identified without the full list of manual CQs for comparison, the analysis indicates that the generated CQs likely explore different angles or dimensions of the subject matter that are not adequately represented in the manual list. A detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint specific questions that are absent from the manual.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.5147882103919983,0.6045739054679871,Which smells are frequently present in paintings but not in texts?,How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the material source associated with a specific sensory stimulus generation event in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are frequently present in texts but not in paintings?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.50
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.50, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity is very low (0.03), suggesting that while the questions may share some conceptual overlap, they differ significantly in terms of the specific terms and structure used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Contextual Exploration**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific contexts (e.g., ""cultural heritage odours"") and processes (e.g., ""identifying material sources""). If the manual list lacks questions that explore these contexts or processes, they could be considered essential.
   
2. **Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes sensory stimulus generation events. If the manual list does not include questions about how sensory stimuli are generated or perceived in relation to cultural heritage, this could represent a gap.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ suggests a comparative analysis between different forms of cultural expression (texts vs. paintings). If the manual list does not include questions that facilitate such comparisons, this could be another area that is missing.

4. **Specificity in Smell**: The generated CQ's focus on ""material source"" and ""specific sensory stimulus"" indicates a need for more detailed questions about the nature of smells in cultural heritage, which may not be captured in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely revolve around the exploration of specific contexts, processes, and comparative analyses related to sensory stimuli and cultural heritage, particularly concerning olfactory experiences.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.5004054307937622,0.6025999784469604,Which smells are frequently present in texts but not in paintings?,How can we identify the material source associated with a specific sensory stimulus generation event in the context of cultural heritage odours?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which sources that are not objects (e.g. emotions, virtues) are described in text as emitting odours (figurative smells)?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.46
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.46, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.03 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual terms used in the questions, which may indicate that while the questions are conceptually related, they are phrased quite differently.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.03) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimuli and Cultural Heritage**: The generated CQ about identifying sensory stimuli related to cultural heritage odours suggests a focus on the intersection of sensory perception and cultural artifacts, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
  
2. **Figurative Language and Emotions**: The generated CQ touches on the figurative aspects of odours and their emotional connotations, which may not be fully explored in the manual CQs. This could indicate a gap in understanding how non-physical sources (like emotions) relate to sensory experiences.

3. **Contextual Analysis of Odours**: The generated CQ implies a need for contextual analysis of odours in cultural heritage, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This could involve exploring how different materials and contexts influence the perception of odours.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ suggests an interdisciplinary approach, linking sensory studies with cultural heritage, which may not be reflected in the manual CQs. This could indicate a broader scope of inquiry that is missing.

In summary, the manual list may lack CQs that explore the nuanced relationships between sensory experiences, cultural heritage, and figurative language, as indicated by the generated CQs. Further analysis of the generated CQs could help identify additional themes or questions that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.45835185050964355,0.5888961553573608,"Which sources that are not objects (e.g. emotions, virtues) are described in text as emitting odours (figurative smells)?",How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial within a cultural heritage context?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which adjectives are used to describe figurative smells?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.27
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic space (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The low cosine similarity score suggests that the questions are not closely related in terms of their vector representations, but they may still touch on similar themes or concepts related to sensory experiences and descriptions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and themes present in the generated CQs. Given the generated CQ about identifying sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts, we can infer several potential areas of inquiry that may not be explicitly covered in the manual list:

1. **Cultural Heritage and Sensory Experience**:
   - Questions that explore how different cultures perceive and describe sensory experiences related to their heritage.
   - Example: ""What sensory experiences are commonly associated with specific cultural artifacts?""

2. **Material Properties and Sensory Perception**:
   - Questions that delve into the relationship between the physical properties of materials and the sensory stimuli they produce.
   - Example: ""How do different materials influence the sensory perceptions of smell and touch in cultural artifacts?""

3. **Adjectives and Descriptive Language**:
   - While the manual CQ touches on adjectives for figurative smells, there may be a broader need for questions that explore the language used to describe sensory experiences in various contexts.
   - Example: ""What vocabulary is used to describe sensory experiences in different cultural narratives?""

4. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**:
   - Questions that integrate insights from psychology, anthropology, and art history regarding sensory experiences in cultural contexts.
   - Example: ""How do psychological factors influence the perception of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage?""

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultures or time periods.
   - Example: ""How do sensory descriptions of cultural artifacts differ between contemporary and historical contexts?""

By considering these areas, we can identify essential CQs that may enhance the understanding of sensory experiences in cultural heritage, which appear to be underrepresented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",0.2725355923175812,0.6253041625022888,Which adjectives are used to describe figurative smells?,How can we identify the sensory stimulus generated by a specific material substantial within a cultural heritage context?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What is the username of the player?""
  
This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.32
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.27

These scores indicate that while there is some level of similarity between the two questions, it is relatively low. The cosine similarity of 0.32 suggests that the questions share some common vector space characteristics, but they are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity of 0.27 further emphasizes that the overlap in terms of unique terms is limited.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and domain of the generated CQs and compare them against the manual list. However, since the specific content of the manual list is not provided, we can infer some general considerations based on the statistics and the nature of the generated CQ.

Given the generated CQ about the ""creators of the Video Game Ontology,"" we can identify several potential essential CQs that might be missing from the manual list:

- **Questions about Relationships**: CQs that explore relationships between different entities in the ontology, such as ""What are the relationships between different video game genres?"" or ""How are characters related to games in the Video Game Ontology?""

- **Questions about Attributes**: CQs that inquire about specific attributes of entities, such as ""What attributes are associated with video games in the ontology?"" or ""What properties define a player in the Video Game Ontology?""

- **Questions about Instances**: CQs that ask for specific instances or examples, such as ""Can you list some examples of video games in the Video Game Ontology?"" or ""What are the different types of players defined in the ontology?""

- **Questions about Usage**: CQs that focus on the application of the ontology, such as ""How can the Video Game Ontology be used in game development?"" or ""What are the benefits of using the Video Game Ontology for game analysis?""

- **Questions about Updates and Versions**: CQs that inquire about the evolution of the ontology, such as ""What are the latest updates to the Video Game Ontology?"" or ""How has the Video Game Ontology changed over time?""

In summary, while the specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the manual list, the analysis suggests that essential questions related to relationships, attributes, instances, usage, and updates of the Video Game Ontology are likely to be important and may be absent from the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.32047200202941895,0.6289992332458496,What is the username of the player?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Who are the friends of the player?""

This pair has the following similarity scores:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.30
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.27

These scores suggest that while the two questions are not highly similar, they represent the highest similarity found between the generated and manual sets. The cosine similarity score of 0.30 indicates a low level of semantic similarity, and the Jaccard similarity score of 0.27 further supports this, showing that there is some overlap in terms of the vocabulary used, but not enough to indicate a strong relationship.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of both the generated and manual CQs. However, based on the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.30 and the maximum of 0.30 suggest that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This indicates that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of the topics or concepts represented in the generated CQs.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision score of 0.00 at a threshold of 0.6 indicates that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated questions were deemed sufficiently similar to any manual questions.

- **Potential Missing Topics**: Given the example of the generated CQ regarding the ""creators of the Video Game Ontology,"" it is possible that the manual list lacks questions related to:
  - The authorship or creation of specific ontologies.
  - Relationships between entities in the context of video games (e.g., creators, characters, game mechanics).
  - Broader topics related to video game ontologies that may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.

In summary, the essential CQs that are likely missing from the manual list would include those that address the creation and authorship of ontologies, relationships between game entities, and other relevant topics that are represented in the generated CQs but not captured in the manual set. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3020382523536682,0.6682915687561035,Who are the friends of the player?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer that:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is relatively low (0.29), indicating that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are significant gaps in the coverage of the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While the specific content of the manual CQs is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions might be missing based on the generated CQs:

1. **Questions about Game Mechanics**: CQs that inquire about the rules, mechanics, or systems within video games, which are essential for understanding gameplay.
  
2. **Questions about Game Development**: CQs that focus on the development aspects of video games, such as design, programming, and production processes.

3. **Questions about Player Interactions**: CQs that explore how players interact with each other and the game environment, including social dynamics and community aspects.

4. **Questions about Game Genres and Categories**: CQs that categorize games into genres or types, which can help in understanding the landscape of video games.

5. **Questions about Game Analytics**: CQs that delve into data analytics related to player behavior, game performance, and engagement metrics.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in CQs that cover a broader range of topics related to video games, particularly those that address game mechanics, development, player interactions, genres, and analytics. This could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs and improve their alignment with the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.2930399775505066,0.646301805973053,Who are the most active players in the game?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are 0.17, which is the maximum value recorded for all pairs. This indicates that, while the similarity is low overall, this specific pair is the closest match between the generated and manual CQs.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for their relevance and coverage of the domain in question. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of generated CQs or a detailed description of the domain, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The overall low similarity scores (average cosine similarity of 0.17, average Jaccard similarity of 0.17, etc.) suggest that the generated CQs may not align well with the manual CQs. This could indicate that the manual list is missing a variety of questions that cover different aspects of the domain, particularly those that are more specific or nuanced.

- **Domain Coverage**: Essential CQs that might be missing could include questions that address:
  - Specific features or attributes of video games (e.g., ""What are the genres of video games available in the ontology?"")
  - User interactions with video games (e.g., ""How can I track my progress in video games?"")
  - Comparisons between different video games (e.g., ""What are the differences between action and strategy games in the ontology?"")
  - Community aspects (e.g., ""What are the social features available in the video game ontology?"")

- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQ about resources related to video game plays suggests a focus on gameplay mechanics or resources, which may not be fully represented in the manual list. Therefore, any questions that explore gameplay strategies, resources, or community engagement could be considered essential and potentially missing.

In summary, while specific missing CQs cannot be identified without a complete list of generated CQs, the analysis indicates that the manual list may lack coverage of various aspects of video games, particularly those that are more detailed or user-focused.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.16583667695522308,0.641787052154541,What are the achievements of my friends?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

However, it is important to note that the similarity scores are relatively low overall, indicating that the generated and manual CQs are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs should cover a wide range of topics relevant to the domain of interest (in this case, video games and ontologies). If the manual list lacks questions that address key concepts, relationships, or entities within this domain, those would be considered missing.

- **Variability in Question Types**: The generated CQs may include different types of questions (e.g., factual, procedural, comparative) that are not represented in the manual list. If the manual list is limited to a narrow type of question, it may miss essential inquiries that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the domain.

- **Depth and Specificity**: The generated CQs might include more specific or in-depth questions that are not present in the manual list. For example, questions that delve into the implications of certain achievements or the impact of creators on the gaming industry could be essential but missing.

Given the low similarity scores and the lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it is likely that the manual list is not exhaustive. To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary. This would involve analyzing the content of the generated CQs to determine which key topics, relationships, or question types are not adequately represented in the manual list.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be pinpointed without additional context or a complete list of generated CQs, it is clear that the manual list may benefit from a broader and more diverse set of questions that cover various aspects of the video game ontology domain.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.20863449573516846,0.6075727343559265,What are the achievements your friend has received?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

These values indicate that while there is some degree of similarity, it is relatively low, suggesting that the content and focus of the questions differ significantly. The maximum cosine similarity across all pairs is also **0.39**, indicating that this is the only pair that reached this level of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your question, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Identify Key Topics:** Review the generated CQs to identify key topics or concepts that are not addressed in the manual list. For example, if the generated CQs include questions about specific features, functionalities, or relationships within the domain of video games that are not present in the manual list, these would be considered missing.

- **Assess Coverage:** Evaluate the breadth of topics covered in the manual list. If certain areas, such as user interactions, game mechanics, or technical specifications, are not represented, then CQs related to those areas may be missing.

- **Consider User Needs:** Think about the potential users of the ontology and what questions they might have that are not captured in the manual list. This could include questions about the ontology's structure, its applications, or its integration with other systems.

- **Compare with Domain Standards:** If there are established standards or frameworks in the domain of video games, compare the manual CQs against these to identify any essential questions that should be included.

In summary, without the specific content of the generated CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint exact missing questions. However, by following the outlined approach, you can systematically identify essential CQs that may not be represented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3872685730457306,0.6543189883232117,What are the types of achievements a game can have?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

This pair has the highest cosine similarity score of 0.36, which is also the maximum score across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.10 indicates a low overlap in terms of unique terms between the two questions, suggesting that while they may share some semantic content, they are not closely aligned in terms of specific vocabulary.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Precision@0.6**: 0.00, indicating that there are no pairs of generated and manual CQs that have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This suggests that the generated CQs do not closely match any of the manual CQs in a significant way.
- **Matches with cosine ≥ 0.6**: 0, confirming that there are no matches that meet this threshold.

Given that the maximum cosine similarity observed is 0.36, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This could imply that the manual list may be missing essential questions that are relevant to the domain of video games and the Video Game Ontology.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While the specific missing CQs cannot be directly identified without access to the content of the generated CQs, we can infer that the following types of questions might be essential but are not represented in the manual list:

- Questions about the relationships between different entities in the Video Game Ontology (e.g., ""What are the relationships between characters and items in the Video Game Ontology?"")
- Questions regarding gameplay mechanics or rules (e.g., ""What are the rules governing player interactions in the game?"")
- Questions about player preferences or behaviors (e.g., ""What types of games do players prefer based on the Video Game Ontology?"")
- Questions about game development or design elements (e.g., ""What are the key design elements of video games as per the Video Game Ontology?"")

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list of CQs may lack depth and variety, particularly in areas that explore relationships, mechanics, and player interactions within the context of video games.

The Jaccard similarity of 0.12 further emphasizes that the overlap in unique terms is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided, particularly focusing on the low similarity scores and the lack of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. The following points can be inferred:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.32, with no pairs reaching a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher. This indicates that the generated CQs may not be effectively capturing the full range of concepts or questions that are relevant to the domain of interest (in this case, video games and ontologies).

- **Lack of Matches**: The precision at 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs matched with a manual CQ at a high similarity threshold. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as the generated CQs are not aligning well with the expected questions.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Given the context of video games and ontologies, essential CQs that might be missing could include:
  - Questions about the relationships between different game genres and their characteristics.
  - Inquiries into the types of data represented in the Video Game Ontology (e.g., game mechanics, player interactions, narrative structures).
  - Questions regarding the evolution of video game design and how it is represented in the ontology.
  - Queries about the impact of player demographics on game design and genre preferences.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in depth and breadth regarding the various aspects of video games and their representation in ontologies. It would be beneficial to expand the manual list to include a wider range of questions that cover different dimensions of the subject matter.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.31764423847198486,0.612276017665863,What is the difficulty level the player uses in certain game genres?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

The low Jaccard score indicates that there are no common words between the two questions, which suggests that while they may have some semantic overlap (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they are not lexically similar. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Coverage of Topics**: The generated CQs should cover a wide range of topics relevant to the domain of interest (in this case, video games and ontologies). If the manual list lacks questions that address key aspects of the domain, those would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Diversity of Question Types**: Essential CQs should include various types of questions, such as factual, comparative, and procedural questions. If the manual list is skewed towards one type, it may miss out on important inquiries.

- **Relevance to User Needs**: The generated CQs should reflect the types of questions that users are likely to ask when interacting with the ontology. If the manual list does not include questions that align with user intent or common queries, those would be essential missing CQs.

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the manual list is lacking in both diversity and coverage. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- Questions about relationships between entities in the ontology (e.g., ""What are the relationships between different video game genres?"")

This aspect may not be covered in the manual list, which seems to focus more on specific scenarios or locations within games.

2. **Player Behavior Analysis**: The generated CQ could also imply a need for questions that explore player behavior, strategies, or interactions within video games, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list.

3. **Ontology and Framework Questions**: The mention of the ""Video Game Ontology"" in the generated CQ suggests a need for questions that delve into the structure, components, and relationships defined within the ontology. This could include questions about how different elements of video games are categorized or related to one another.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare different video games, genres, or player experiences could also be missing. For example, ""How do different video game genres affect player engagement?"" would be an essential CQ that explores broader themes.

5. **Impact of Game Design**: Questions that address the impact of game design on player experience or outcomes, such as ""What design elements contribute to player retention in video games?"" could also be relevant and missing.

In summary, the manual list may lack CQs that explore broader themes related to resources, player behavior, ontology structures, comparative analyses, and the impact of game design, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.2338641881942749,0.5967479348182678,What is the location in map where the players die the most?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.39** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.07**. The cosine similarity indicates that there is some degree of similarity in the vector representations of the two questions, but the relatively low Jaccard similarity suggests that the overlap in terms of shared words or tokens is minimal. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the context and domain of the generated CQs and compare them against the manual list. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of either the generated or manual CQs, we can infer some general points based on the provided data:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of the Video Game Ontology, such as creators and equipment. If the manual list lacks questions about other critical components of the ontology, such as game mechanics, player interactions, or narrative elements, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Diversity of Questions**: The generated CQs may include a variety of question types (e.g., who, what, how) that are not fully represented in the manual list. If the manual list predominantly features one type of question (e.g., only ""what"" questions), it may miss out on essential inquiries that could be framed as ""who"" or ""how.""

- **Specificity and Detail**: If the generated CQs include more detailed or specific inquiries about the ontology (e.g., ""What are the relationships between different entities in the Video Game Ontology?""), and these are not reflected in the manual list, they would be considered essential missing CQs.

In summary, without the actual lists of generated and manual CQs, we cannot pinpoint specific missing questions. However, the analysis suggests that essential CQs could include broader coverage of the ontology's components, a variety of question types, and more detailed inquiries that are not currently represented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3940940797328949,0.5958651900291443,What equipment does a player have in a game?,What are the creators of the Video Game Ontology?

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What consumable items does a player have in game?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.40** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.05**. The cosine similarity indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is very low, suggesting that the questions use different vocabulary and focus on different aspects of the video game domain.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is low (0.40), and the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

The following points can be inferred regarding potentially missing essential CQs:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics related to video games, such as player interactions, game mechanics, or narrative elements, which may not be fully represented in the manual list. If the manual list is focused primarily on consumable items, it may miss questions about other resources, such as character attributes, game environments, or player achievements.

- **Specificity and Detail**: The generated CQ about ""resources related to video game plays"" suggests a focus on various types of resources (not just consumables) that could include in-game currency, equipment, or even non-tangible resources like experience points. If the manual list lacks questions that address these broader categories, it may be missing essential CQs.

- **Contextual Understanding**: The generated CQ indicates a need for understanding the context of video game ontology, which may include relationships between different entities in the game. If the manual list does not include questions that explore these relationships or the structure of the ontology, it may be lacking in essential CQs.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address:
- A wider range of resources beyond consumables.
- Relationships and interactions within the game ontology.
- Specific aspects of gameplay mechanics and player experiences.

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary, focusing on the themes and topics that are underrepresented in the manual.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.3981666564941406,0.6338387727737427,What consumable items does a player have in game?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the games where a player can use this item?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.51** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.14**. The cosine similarity indicates that the two questions share a moderate level of semantic similarity, while the Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is relatively low. This suggests that while the questions may be related in context (both pertain to video games), they differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for coverage of key concepts and themes that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs beyond the highest similarity pair is not provided, we can infer some general strategies for identifying missing CQs:

- **Thematic Coverage**: Review the generated CQs to identify themes or topics that are not addressed in the manual list. For example, if the generated CQs include questions about specific aspects of video game mechanics, player interactions, or game design principles that are absent from the manual list, these would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Diversity of Inquiry**: Assess whether the generated CQs explore different types of inquiries, such as those focusing on player experiences, game development processes, or the impact of video games on culture. If the manual list is heavily focused on one type of question (e.g., resource identification), it may lack essential questions that cover other dimensions of video games.

- **Specificity and Detail**: Examine the level of specificity in the generated CQs. If the generated CQs include detailed questions about particular games, genres, or player behaviors that are not reflected in the manual list, these would be essential additions.

In summary, without the complete list of generated CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint specific missing questions. However, a thorough analysis of the generated CQs against the manual list should reveal gaps in thematic coverage, diversity of inquiry, and specificity that could highlight essential CQs that are currently missing.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.5139200687408447,0.6598829627037048,What are the games where a player can use this item?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the statistics provided do not include a comprehensive list of the generated CQs or the manual CQs, we can only infer based on the similarity metrics.

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the manual list lacks several generated CQs that cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain related to video games, in-app purchases, or the Video Game Ontology. Essential CQs that might be missing could include:

- Questions about specific types of video game resources (e.g., ""What types of in-game currencies are available in video games?"")
- Questions regarding user behavior in video games (e.g., ""How do player demographics affect in-app purchase behavior?"")
- Questions about the impact of video game design on player engagement (e.g., ""What design elements in video games lead to increased player retention?"")
- Questions about the relationship between video game features and player spending (e.g., ""How do different game mechanics influence in-app purchase frequency?"")

To accurately identify the missing essential CQs, a detailed review of both the generated and manual lists would be necessary, focusing on the themes and topics that are underrepresented in the manual list. The low similarity scores suggest that there may be significant gaps in the manual CQs that could be filled by the generated ones.","[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]",0.06417623162269592,0.5905662775039673,What time are most of the in-app purchases done?,What are the resources related to video game plays described by the Video Game Ontology?

This suggests that the generated and manual questions share some thematic elements but are largely distinct in their wording and focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided in your query, I can only suggest a general approach to identify missing essential CQs:

- **Identify Key Themes:** Review the generated CQs for key themes or topics that are not represented in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs focus on specific aspects of the ontology (like data types, units of measure, or interaction patterns) that are not addressed in the manual CQs, these could be considered essential missing questions.

- **Coverage of Ontological Concepts:** Check if the generated CQs cover all relevant concepts and relationships defined in the ontology. If certain concepts are only addressed in the generated CQs and not in the manual ones, those questions should be flagged as missing.

- **Diversity of Inquiry:** Assess whether the generated CQs explore different types of inquiries (e.g., definitions, relationships, examples) that are not captured in the manual list. If the manual list is heavily focused on one type of question, it may lack essential inquiries that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ontology.

Given the low similarity scores and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it is likely that there are several essential CQs in the generated set that are not reflected in the manual list. A detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint specific missing questions accurately.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.18552625179290771,0.6084463596343994,Which are the relationships a partnership is involved in?,What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern in the Web of Things ontology?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the low similarity scores across the board, particularly the average cosine similarity of 0.06 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.00, it suggests that the generated CQs do not align well with the manual CQs. 

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following:

- **Domain Coverage**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of data types and properties (e.g., ""data type and unit of measure,"" ""interaction pattern,"" ""hasInputData property""). If the manual list lacks questions that address these technical aspects, it may be missing essential CQs that are relevant to the domain of data interactions and properties.

- **Granularity of Questions**: The generated CQs may include more detailed or technical inquiries that are not present in the manual list. For instance, questions about specific data types, units of measure, or the relationships between different properties (like ""hasInputData"") could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the context of the domain they are addressing (in this case, the Web of Things ontology). Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs are exploring different aspects or dimensions of the ontology that are not captured in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Data Types and Units**: The generated CQ about data types and units suggests a focus on the specifics of data representation in the ontology. A manual CQ addressing the expected data types and units for various entities or interactions in the ontology could be essential.
   
2. **Interaction Patterns**: The generated CQ mentions ""interaction patterns,"" which may imply a need for questions that explore the types of interactions defined in the ontology, their characteristics, and how they relate to different entities.

3. **Ownership Relationships**: While the manual CQ addresses roles in ownership relationships, there may be additional questions regarding the nature of ownership, how it is defined in the ontology, and the implications of ownership on data management and interactions.

4. **Contextual Relationships**: Questions that explore how different entities interact within the ontology, including contextual relationships and dependencies, may also be missing.

5. **Use Cases**: CQs that focus on practical applications or use cases of the ontology could provide valuable insights that are not currently represented in the manual list.

In summary, the generated CQs seem to cover specific technical aspects of the ontology that may not be fully represented in the manual list. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs in detail to identify any additional essential questions that could enhance the understanding and usability of the ontology.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.12930245697498322,0.6642961502075195,Which roles are involved in a ownership relationship?,What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern in the Web of Things ontology?

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.15
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair represents the highest similarity across all evaluated pairs, with both the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores being notably low. The cosine similarity of 0.15 indicates a very weak semantic similarity, while the Jaccard similarity of 0.04 suggests that there is minimal overlap in the sets of words used in the two questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Data Types and Units**: The generated CQ about data types and units of measure suggests a focus on the technical specifications of interaction patterns, which may not be addressed in the manual list.
2. **Interaction Patterns**: The generated CQ specifically mentions ""interaction patterns,"" indicating a focus on the dynamics of how entities interact within the Web of Things, which may be absent from the manual list.
3. **Ontology Specificity**: The mention of the ""Web of Things ontology"" in the generated CQ implies a need for questions that are specific to the ontology's structure and semantics, which may not be captured in the manual CQs.

Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the manual list lacks coverage of technical and domain-specific questions that are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the Web of Things ontology.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Data Type and Measurement**: The generated CQ about the data type and unit of measure indicates a focus on technical specifications that may be crucial for understanding interactions in a system. If the manual list lacks questions addressing data types, units of measure, or specific properties of data interactions, this could be a significant gap.

2. **User Interaction Context**: The generated CQ about interaction patterns suggests a focus on user interactions with data. If the manual list does not include questions about how users interact with data or the context of these interactions, this could represent a missing area of inquiry.

3. **Property Relationships**: The mention of the property ""hasInputData"" in the generated CQ indicates a need for questions that explore relationships between different properties or entities. If the manual list does not include questions about property relationships or how different entities interact, this could be another essential area that is missing.

4. **Specificity in User Roles**: The manual CQ ""What is a user?"" is quite broad. If the generated CQs include more specific roles or types of users (e.g., ""What roles do users play in data interactions?""), this specificity may be lacking in the manual list.

In summary, the generated CQs seem to address more technical and specific aspects of data interactions and user roles, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs for additional themes or topics that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.08783707022666931,0.52463299036026,What is a user?,"What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern linked through the property ""hasInputData""?"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs. Given that the average similarity scores across various metrics are low, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ about ""data type and unit of measure"" indicates a focus on technical specifications within the Web of Things ontology. If the manual list lacks questions that address technical aspects of data representation, it may be missing essential CQs relevant to users needing detailed information about data structures.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: The generated CQ implies a need for understanding interaction patterns in the Web of Things. If the manual list does not include questions about interaction patterns, user interactions, or contextual applications of the ontology, it may be missing essential CQs that provide a comprehensive understanding of the ontology's use cases.

3. **Comparative or Relational Queries**: The generated CQs may also include comparative questions (e.g., ""How does an interaction pattern differ from a data model in the Web of Things?""). If the manual list lacks such comparative or relational questions, it may not fully capture the breadth of inquiries users might have.

4. **Broader Conceptual Questions**: The manual list may be missing broader conceptual questions that explore the implications of the ontology, such as ""What are the implications of using the Web of Things ontology in smart cities?"" or ""How does the Web of Things ontology facilitate interoperability?""

In summary, the manual list may benefit from including more technical, contextual, comparative, and conceptual questions to ensure a comprehensive representation of user inquiries related to the Web of Things ontology. The low similarity scores indicate a significant gap that could be addressed by expanding the manual CQs to encompass these areas.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.1415477991104126,0.5745857954025269,What is a building?,What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern in the Web of Things ontology?

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Domain-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ about ""data type and unit of measure"" suggests a focus on technical specifications that may not be addressed in the manual list. This indicates a potential gap in the manual CQs regarding the technical or data-oriented aspects of the domain.
- **Property-Specific Questions**: The mention of ""hasInputData property"" in the generated CQ implies that there may be other property-specific questions that are relevant but not captured in the manual list. For example, questions about other properties or relationships within the domain could be missing.
- **Contextual or Functional Queries**: The generated CQ seems to inquire about the functionality and context of data interactions, which may not be reflected in the more general manual CQ (""Where is something located?""). This suggests that more context-driven questions could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs, as evidenced by the low similarity scores. The manual list may be missing essential questions that address specific data types, properties, and functional contexts relevant to the domain. To enhance the completeness of the manual CQs, it would be beneficial to incorporate more technical and context-specific questions that reflect the nuances captured in the generated CQs.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.0860728919506073,0.5540814995765686,Where is something located?,What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern linked through the hasInputData property?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Data Types and Units**: The generated CQ regarding the data type and unit of measure for interaction patterns suggests a focus on the technical specifications of the ontology, which may not be addressed in the manual list.
- **Interaction Patterns**: The mention of ""interaction patterns"" in the generated CQ indicates a specific aspect of the Web of Things ontology that may not be covered in the manual CQs.
- **Versioning**: While the manual CQ mentions versioning, it does not seem to address the broader context of how versioning interacts with data types or units of measure, which could be an essential aspect of understanding the ontology.

Given the average cosine similarity of 0.27 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.00, it is clear that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This suggests that there may be significant gaps in the manual list, particularly in areas related to technical specifications, interaction patterns, and the relationships between different components of the ontology.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the highest similarity pair has a low level of semantic overlap, indicating that the generated CQs may be exploring different dimensions of the ontology that are not captured in the manual list. Essential CQs related to data types, units of measure, and interaction patterns appear to be missing from the manual list, highlighting potential areas for further development and refinement in the competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.27041012048721313,0.49174022674560547,Service thing description should includeits version?,What is the data type and unit of measure expected by an interaction pattern in the Web of Things ontology?

However, the Jaccard similarity of 0.10 indicates that the overlap in terms of unique terms is quite low, suggesting that while the questions may be related in context, they do not share many common words.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the overall statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is relatively low (0.49), and the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, it indicates that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list when compared to the generated CQs.

**Key Observations**:
- The maximum cosine similarity is capped at 0.49, suggesting that none of the generated CQs are closely aligned with the manual CQs, which may indicate that the manual list lacks coverage of certain topics or phrasing present in the generated CQs.
- The average Jaccard similarity of 0.10 and BLEU score of 0.01 further reinforce the idea that the generated CQs are not well represented in the manual list, as they do not share much vocabulary or structure.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- Given the context of the generated CQ regarding ""data type and unit of measure"" and ""interaction patterns,"" it is likely that essential CQs related to data specifications, interaction protocols, or specific use cases in the Web of Things ontology are missing from the manual list.
- Additionally, questions that explore the relationships between different entities in the ontology, or those that inquire about the implications of interaction patterns on service descriptions, may also be absent.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the pair with the highest similarity has a cosine similarity of 0.49, indicating a moderate semantic relationship.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated competency questions (CQs) and the provided statistics, it appears that the manual list may be lacking in the following essential areas:

1. **Focus on Specific Types of Empirical Evidence:**
   - The generated CQs emphasize the need for specific types of empirical evidence (e.g., case studies, experiments, surveys) that are necessary to bridge the gap between research and practice. The manual list could benefit from more questions that explicitly ask about these specific types of evidence and their roles in requirements engineering.

2. **Connection Between Research and Practice:**
   - The generated CQs highlight the importance of understanding how empirical evidence can be applied in practice. Questions that explore the practical implications of research findings or how empirical methods can be effectively utilized in real-world scenarios are missing.

3. **Evolution of Empirical Methods:**
   - The generated CQs inquire about the evolution of empirical methods over time, which is a critical aspect of understanding trends in research. The manual list could include questions that track changes in methodologies and their impact on the field.

4. **Quality Assessment of Empirical Research:**
   - The generated CQs mention the criteria for assessing the quality of empirical research. Questions that focus on how to evaluate the strength and reliability of empirical studies in requirements engineering are essential and currently absent from the manual list.

5. **Quantitative Aspects of Empirical Studies:**
   - The generated CQs also touch on the quantitative aspects of empirical studies, such as the number of studies conducted by specific demographics (e.g., authors from large software companies). This quantitative perspective is important for understanding the landscape of empirical research and is not sufficiently represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list could be enhanced by incorporating questions that address specific types of empirical evidence, the connection between research and practice, the evolution of methodologies, quality assessment criteria, and quantitative aspects of empirical studies. This would provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the role of empirical evidence in requirements engineering.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.5406005382537842,0.7201015949249268,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the themes and focus areas of the generated questions. The generated question emphasizes the structuring and evaluation of empirical knowledge regarding methods and techniques in requirements engineering, specifically focusing on:

- **Appropriateness and Desirability:** The generated question seeks to understand how empirical knowledge can be assessed for its relevance and effectiveness in the context of requirements engineering.
- **Identification of Gaps in Research:** It aims to identify main focuses and gaps in the existing research, which is crucial for guiding future studies and improving methodologies.

Given this focus, the following essential CQs could be considered missing from the manual list:

1. **Evaluation of Methodologies:** Questions that specifically address how different methodologies in requirements engineering are evaluated for their effectiveness and appropriateness.
   
2. **Research Gaps Identification:** Questions that focus on identifying gaps in current research, which could help in directing future studies and improving empirical methods.

3. **Comparative Analysis of Techniques:** Questions that explore how various techniques in requirements engineering compare in terms of their outcomes and effectiveness.

4. **Trends in Empirical Research:** Questions that investigate trends over time in the use of different empirical methods within the field, which could provide insights into the evolution of practices.

5. **Impact of Empirical Knowledge on Practice:** Questions that examine how empirical findings influence practical applications in requirements engineering.

By including these types of questions, the manual list could be enhanced to better capture the breadth of inquiry relevant to empirical methods and techniques in requirements engineering.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.4993366599082947,0.696514904499054,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions and their focus areas. The generated question emphasizes empirical research practices in requirements engineering, which suggests several potential areas that may not be fully covered in the manual list:

1. **Focus on Empirical Research Practices:**
   - The generated question specifically addresses the practices of researchers and practitioners in requirements engineering. If the manual list lacks questions that explore the methodologies, tools, or frameworks used in empirical research within this domain, it would be a significant omission.

2. **Comparative Analysis of Research Methods:**
   - Questions that compare different empirical research methods or practices in requirements engineering could be missing. For example, inquiries about the effectiveness of qualitative vs. quantitative methods in this field would be valuable.

3. **Trends and Evolution in Research Practices:**
   - The generated question hints at the evolution of empirical practices over time. If the manual list does not include questions that explore historical trends or shifts in research methodologies, this could be a critical gap.

4. **Impact of Research on Industry Practices:**
   - Questions that investigate how empirical research findings influence actual practices in software development and requirements engineering may also be absent. This could include inquiries about the adoption of research findings in industry settings.

5. **Stakeholder Perspectives:**
   - Questions that consider the perspectives of different stakeholders (e.g., researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders) regarding empirical research practices could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the field.

In summary, while the manual list may contain valuable questions, it may lack depth in exploring empirical research practices, comparative analyses, historical trends, industry impacts, and stakeholder perspectives in requirements engineering. Addressing these areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.5748183131217957,0.7107070088386536,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated CQs and the provided statistics, it appears that the manual list may be lacking in several essential areas that are covered by the generated CQs. Here are some potential missing essential CQs:

1. **Focus Areas and Trends in Empirical Research:**
   - The generated CQ ""What are the major focus areas and trends in empirical research within requirements engineering?"" highlights a need for questions that explore the overarching themes and trends in empirical research. This aspect is not explicitly covered in the manual list.

2. **Comparative Analysis of Definitions:**
   - The generated CQs suggest a need for questions that compare and contrast the use of conceptual and operational definitions across different studies or over time. For example, a question like ""How do different studies define key constructs in empirical research in SE and RE?"" could be valuable.

3. **Evolution of Research Practices:**
   - The generated CQ regarding the evolution of definitions over time indicates a gap in the manual list concerning the historical perspective of research practices. A question such as ""How have the methodologies in empirical research evolved in SE and RE?"" could be beneficial.

4. **Industry-Specific Research:**
   - The generated CQ about the number of empirical studies by authors from large software development companies points to a potential gap in understanding the influence of industry context on research outcomes. A question like ""What is the impact of industry affiliation on the findings of empirical studies in SE and RE?"" could be relevant.

5. **Sub-fields Coverage:**
   - The generated CQ regarding the coverage of sub-fields in empirical studies suggests that the manual list may lack questions that delve into the specific areas of focus within SE and RE. A question such as ""What sub-fields are most frequently studied in empirical research within SE and RE?"" could enhance the manual list.

In summary, the manual list could benefit from incorporating questions that address overarching themes, comparative analyses, historical perspectives, industry contexts, and specific sub-fields within the domain of requirements engineering and software engineering.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.526625394821167,0.7421307563781738,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated CQs and the statistics provided, several essential CQs appear to be missing from the manual list. These may include:

1. **Trends in Software Engineering Research:**
   - The generated CQs focus on identifying and analyzing trends in software engineering research. The manual list lacks questions that directly address the identification of these trends, which is crucial for understanding the landscape of software engineering research.

2. **Comparative Analysis of Research Methods:**
   - While some manual questions touch on empirical studies, there is a lack of questions that compare different research methodologies (e.g., case studies vs. experiments) and their effectiveness or prevalence in the literature.

3. **Temporal Evolution of Research Focus:**
   - The generated CQs suggest an interest in how research focuses have changed over time. The manual list does not seem to capture questions that explore the temporal evolution of specific research areas or methodologies in software engineering.

4. **Impact of Industry Practices:**
   - Questions that investigate how industry practices influence research trends or how research adapts to industry needs are not present in the manual list. This is an important aspect of software engineering research that connects academic findings with practical applications.

5. **Quantitative Analysis of Research Outputs:**
   - The generated CQs imply a need for quantitative analysis of research outputs, such as the number of studies published over time or the distribution of research types. The manual list could benefit from including questions that quantify these aspects.

In summary, the manual list could be enhanced by incorporating questions that address trends in research, comparative analyses of methodologies, temporal changes in focus, the impact of industry practices, and quantitative assessments of research outputs. These additions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the software engineering research landscape.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.5811368823051453,0.7243351936340332,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated competency questions (CQs), the following essential CQs appear to be missing from the manual list:

1. **Types of Evidence in Empirical Software Engineering:**
   - The generated question emphasizes the types of evidence produced by empirical software engineers and their relevance to practitioners. This aspect is not explicitly covered in the manual questions, which focus more on the quantity of studies or specific methods rather than the nature of the evidence itself.

2. **Relation of Evidence to Practice:**
   - The generated question also addresses how the types of evidence relate to the relevance of empirical software engineering to practitioners. This connection between evidence and practical application is crucial for understanding the impact of empirical studies on real-world software engineering practices, which is not reflected in the manual questions.

3. **Justification of Method Selection:**
   - While there is a question in the manual about how authors justify the selection of methods, the generated question's focus on the relationship between evidence types and their relevance suggests a deeper inquiry into the rationale behind methodological choices, which could be further explored.

4. **Synthesis of Evidence:**
   - The generated question hints at the synthesis of evidence from various empirical methods, which is a critical aspect of empirical research that may not be fully captured in the manual questions.

5. **Evolution of Empirical Methods:**
   - The generated question implies a need to understand how the types of evidence and methods have evolved over time, which is a broader historical perspective that could be beneficial for practitioners and researchers alike.

In summary, the generated CQs highlight the importance of understanding the types of evidence and their relevance to practice, as well as the justification and evolution of empirical methods, which are not adequately represented in the manual list.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",0.6921971440315247,0.677204966545105,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs and compare them with the manual ones. The generated CQs focus on the evolution of empirical evaluations in software engineering, particularly in the context of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). 

Given the statistics and the context, the following essential CQs could be considered missing from the manual list:

1. **Evolution of Empirical Evaluations:** The generated CQs emphasize the evolution of both the quantity and quality of empirical evaluations in software engineering papers. If the manual list lacks questions that specifically address how these evaluations have changed over time, it would be a significant omission.

2. **Criteria for Quality Assessment:** The generated CQs also touch on the criteria used to assess the quality of studies. If the manual list does not include questions about the criteria or standards for evaluating empirical studies, this could be a critical gap.

3. **Proportion of Studies Without Empirical Evidence:** The generated CQs inquire about the proportion of papers lacking empirical studies. If the manual list does not address this aspect, it may miss an important dimension of empirical research in software engineering.

4. **Impact of Author Affiliations:** The generated CQs mention the affiliations of authors (e.g., large software development companies). If the manual list does not include questions regarding how author affiliations impact the quality or quantity of empirical studies, this could be another essential area that is overlooked.

5. **Temporal Trends in Empirical Research:** Questions that explore trends over time in empirical research methodologies, findings, or publication practices may also be missing from the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may lack questions that specifically address the evolution of empirical evaluations, criteria for quality assessment, proportions of studies without empirical evidence, impacts of author affiliations, and temporal trends in empirical research. These areas are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of empirical evaluations in software engineering.","[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 5.0}]",0.49879691004753113,0.7825352549552917,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?
