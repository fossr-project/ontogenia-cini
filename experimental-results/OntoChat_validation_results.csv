### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that have the highest cosine similarity with the manual CQs. The following points can be considered:

- **Focus on Specific Properties:** The generated CQs often reference specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"" and ""od:F10_targeted""). If the manual list lacks questions that inquire about these properties, it may miss essential aspects of the domain being addressed.

- **Contextual Understanding of Odours:** The generated CQs seem to focus on the application and association of smells with certain properties or instances. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the context in which specific odours are mentioned or their implications, it may lack depth.

- **Examples and Ranges:** The generated CQs also ask for examples and ranges related to specific properties. If the manual list does not include questions that seek examples of how properties are used or the range of values they can take, it may not fully capture the necessary breadth of inquiry.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely include:

- Questions that specifically ask about the properties associated with odours (e.g., ""What are the properties associated with [specific odour]?"").
- Inquiries into the context and implications of odours in various scenarios (e.g., ""How do different contexts affect the perception of [specific odour]?"").
- Requests for examples and ranges related to the properties of odours (e.g., ""What are some examples of how the property od:F1_generated is applied in practice?"").

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs and their context. The generated CQs focus on specific properties and associations related to smells, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. Here are some observations:

- **Focus on Properties and Associations:** The generated CQs often reference specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"", ""od:F10_targeted"") and their relationships to stimuli or comments. This suggests that the manual list may lack questions that explore the implications of these properties in detail. For example:
  - ""What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?"" is a question that probes deeper into the relationships between properties and instances, which may be essential for understanding the domain.

- **Examples and Ranges:** The generated CQs also include inquiries about examples and ranges of properties, which are crucial for practical applications. For instance:
  - ""What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?"" and ""What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?"" highlight the need for practical examples and definitions of the properties, which may be missing from the manual list.

- **Contextual Understanding:** The generated CQs seem to aim for a more nuanced understanding of the context in which smells are described, which may not be fully addressed in the manual. Questions that explore the context of smell descriptions across different demographics (urban vs. rural) could be essential.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions that have not been matched with any manual questions based on the provided statistics. 

Given the low average cosine similarity (0.16) and the fact that no pairs achieved a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated questions may not align well with the manual questions. 

**Potential Missing CQs:**
1. **Focus on Specific Properties:** The generated questions often reference specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"", ""od:F10_targeted""). If the manual list does not include questions that explore these properties in detail, it may lack essential inquiries related to the specific attributes of the subject matter.
  
2. **Contextual Applications:** Questions like ""What is the thing to which the smell was applied?"" suggest a need for contextual applications of smell in various professions. If the manual list does not address how smell is applied in different contexts or professions, it may be missing critical CQs.

3. **Examples and Ranges:** The generated questions inquire about examples and ranges of properties (e.g., ""What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?""). If the manual list lacks questions that seek examples or ranges of application, it may not fully cover the breadth of inquiry needed.

### Conclusion
In summary, the pairs with the highest similarity primarily revolve around the theme of smell and its application in specific contexts, with the highest cosine similarity being 0.49. The manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on specific properties, contextual applications, and examples related to the subject matter.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that did not find a close match in the manual list. Given the low average cosine similarity (0.23) and the fact that no generated CQs had a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any manual CQs, it suggests that there may be significant gaps in the manual list.

The generated CQs that stand out as potentially essential but are not well represented in the manual list include:

1. **""What is the thing to which the smell was applied?""**  
   This question addresses the application context of smells, which may be crucial for understanding the relationship between smells and their descriptions.

2. **""; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?""**  
   This CQ seems to inquire about the variability or extent of a specific property related to smells, which could be important for a comprehensive understanding of the data.

3. **""; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?""**  
   This question suggests a need for qualitative insights or annotations related to the property, which could enhance the understanding of the data.

4. **""; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?""**  
   This CQ indicates a relationship inquiry that could be vital for linking stimuli to their descriptions or effects.

5. **""; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?""**  
   This question seeks practical examples, which are often essential for understanding theoretical concepts in applied contexts.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions that have a higher cosine similarity with the manual questions. 

Given that the manual question ""Which practice changed the smells it produced over time?"" has a high cosine similarity with the generated question ""What is the thing to which the smell was applied?"" (0.64), it suggests that the manual list may lack questions that explore the relationship between practices and sensory experiences (in this case, smells).

**Potential Missing CQs:**
- Questions that explore the relationship between practices and sensory attributes, such as:
  - ""How do different practices influence the perception of smells?""
  - ""What are the effects of various practices on the olfactory characteristics of substances?""
  
- Questions that inquire about the properties associated with sensory experiences:
  - ""What properties are linked to the generation of specific smells in different practices?""
  - ""How is the property od:F1_generated related to sensory experiences in various contexts?""

- Questions that delve into the application of sensory properties in practices:
  - ""In what ways are smells applied in different practices?""
  - ""What examples illustrate the application of sensory properties in practice?""

These questions would complement the existing manual list by addressing the broader context of sensory experiences and their relationship with practices, which appears to be a significant theme in the generated questions.",0.5636363744735717,Which practice changed the smells it produced over time?,What is the thing to which the smell was applied?; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?,0.2664563059806824,0.6555954813957214,"[0.6422016024589539, 0.1504024863243103, 0.1884130835533142, 0.15880835056304932, 0.1924559473991394]",0.2,,1,0.6422016024589539,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}, {'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 2, 'Average': 2.6666666666666665}]"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions that have not been matched with any manual questions, particularly those that might cover different aspects of the topic.

Given the statistics provided, the following observations can be made:

- **Diversity of Topics:** The generated questions seem to focus on specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"" and ""od:F10_targeted"") and their associations. If the manual list does not include questions that explore these properties or their implications, it may lack depth in understanding the domain.

- **Contextual Relevance:** The generated questions often inquire about associations, comments, and examples related to specific properties. If the manual list does not address these inquiries, it may miss out on critical contextual information that could enhance understanding.

- **Missing Perspectives:** The manual list may not include questions that explore the implications of the practices associated with smell, such as ""What are the effects of the practices that produced/reduced smell?"" or ""What are the historical contexts of these practices?"" These questions could provide a broader understanding of the topic.

### Conclusion
In summary, the pairs with the highest similarity primarily revolve around the first generated question and its manual counterpart, while the other pairs show weaker relationships. Essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list include those that explore specific properties, their implications, and broader contextual inquiries related to the practices associated with smell.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that have not been matched with any manual CQs, particularly those that exhibit higher cosine similarities. 

Given the statistics, the following observations can be made:

- The generated CQs that have the highest cosine similarity (0.60) with the manual CQ focus on the concept of ""smell"" and ""protective scents."" This indicates that the manual list may lack questions that explore the relationship between scents and their applications or properties.

- The generated CQs that have lower cosine similarities (0.17, 0.15, 0.13) also revolve around the properties associated with ""od:F1_generated"" and ""od:F10_targeted."" This suggests that the manual list may be missing questions that delve into the specifics of these properties and their implications in the context of health or scent.

### Suggested Missing CQs:
1. **What are the applications of protective scents in health contexts?**
2. **How does the property od:F1_generated relate to the generation of stimuli?**
3. **What is the significance of the property od:F10_targeted in scent applications?**

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions for their thematic content and relevance to the subject matter. 

The generated questions focus on specific properties and associations related to stimuli and their effects, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. Here are some observations:

- **Focus on Properties and Associations:** The generated questions often reference specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"", ""od:F10_targeted"") and their relationships to stimuli. This suggests a need for manual CQs that explore how these properties interact with various stimuli or contexts. For example:
  - ""What are the implications of the property od:F1_generated on sensory experiences?""
  - ""How does the property od:F10_targeted influence the perception of smells in paintings?""

- **Contextual Applications:** The generated questions inquire about the application of properties in specific contexts (e.g., ""What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?""). This indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that seek to understand the scope and limitations of these properties:
  - ""What is the range of sensory stimuli that can be associated with the property od:F1_generated?""

- **Examples and Case Studies:** The generated questions also ask for examples of how properties are used, which is crucial for understanding practical applications. The manual list could benefit from questions like:
  - ""Can you provide examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is utilized in artistic representations?""

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated questions, several essential competency questions (CQs) appear to be missing from the manual list. These questions focus on specific properties and associations related to the concept of smell and its representation in art, particularly in the context of Dutch paintings from the 18th century. Here are some observations:

- **Focus on Properties and Associations:** The generated questions often inquire about specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"") and their associations with stimuli or reactions. The manual list does not seem to address these specific properties, which could be crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

- **Exploration of Reactions to Smells:** The manual question primarily focuses on reactions to smells in paintings. However, the generated questions delve into the mechanisms of how these reactions are represented or associated with specific properties, which is a critical aspect that is not covered in the manual list.

- **Examples and Applications:** The generated questions ask for examples of how certain properties are used, which is an important aspect of understanding the practical implications of the concepts being studied. The manual list lacks questions that seek to provide concrete examples or applications of the properties related to smells.

In summary, the manual list could benefit from including questions that explore the specific properties associated with smells, their applications, and the mechanisms of reactions to smells in the context of art, particularly in Dutch paintings of the 18th century.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that have not been matched with any manual CQs based on the provided statistics. 

Given that the maximum cosine similarity between any generated CQ and the manual CQs is 0.58, and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may not align closely with the manual CQs in terms of content or focus.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"", ""od:F10_targeted"") and their associations or ranges, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. 
- The manual CQs appear to be more general and focused on human reactions to smells, while the generated CQs delve into more technical aspects of properties and their applications.

### Conclusion:
- The manual list may be missing CQs that address the technical aspects of properties related to smells, their associations, and examples of usage. This could include questions about how specific properties are defined, their implications in various contexts, and their relationships to sensory experiences. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there are some pairs with notable similarities, the generated CQs may not sufficiently cover the breadth of essential questions that could be included in the manual list, particularly those that explore the technical dimensions of the subject matter.",0.6011054158210755,What sort of people react to smells in paintings?,What is the thing to which the smell was applied?; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?,0.2164166420698166,0.658154308795929,"[0.5808560848236084, 0.08748602867126465, 0.15920767188072205, 0.11138149350881577, 0.14315199851989746]",0.0,,0,0.5808560848236084,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}]"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions that did not find a strong match in the manual set. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated questions may not align well with the manual questions.

The generated questions that have the highest cosine similarity (though still below 0.6) indicate potential areas where the manual list could be expanded. Here are some observations:

- The generated questions focus on specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"" and ""od:F10_targeted"") and their associations or applications. This suggests that the manual list may be lacking in questions that explore the relationships between properties and their implications in the context of smells and paintings.

- The generated questions also hint at a need for more exploratory questions regarding the application of smells in art, such as:
  - ""What are the implications of using specific smells in paintings?""
  - ""How do different properties affect the perception of smells in art?""

- Additionally, questions that delve into the broader context of smells in relation to various subjects (like ""field work"") could be beneficial. For example:
  - ""What role do smells play in the interpretation of paintings related to [field work]?""

In summary, the manual list could be enhanced by including questions that address the relationships between specific properties and their applications, as well as broader contextual inquiries about the role of smells in art. This would provide a more comprehensive set of competency questions that align with the generated questions.",0.6026078581809997,Which smells are possible to find in paintings whose subject is [field work]?,What is the thing to which the smell was applied?; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?,0.23468908667564392,0.6359542012214661,"[0.5386745929718018, 0.1415719985961914, 0.1612931787967682, 0.17715612053871155, 0.15474961698055267]",0.0,,0,0.5386745929718018,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 2, 'Average': 3.0}]"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions for their thematic content and intent. The generated questions seem to focus on specific properties and associations related to the concept of smell, particularly in the context of stimulus generation and its application. 

Here are some observations regarding potential missing CQs:

- **Focus on Properties and Associations:** The generated questions often inquire about specific properties (e.g., ""od:F1_generated"") and their associations with instances or comments. This suggests a need for manual CQs that explore the relationships between smells and their properties in more detail. For example:
  - ""What properties are associated with different types of smells?""
  - ""How do specific smells influence the perception of art?""

- **Contextual Applications:** The generated questions also hint at the application of smells in various contexts (e.g., paintings vs. texts). This could lead to essential CQs that explore the contextual relevance of smells:
  - ""In what contexts are certain smells more prevalent?""
  - ""How do smells differ in artistic representations compared to textual descriptions?""

- **Examples and Use Cases:** The generated questions ask for examples of how properties are used, which is a critical aspect of understanding competency in a domain. Missing CQs could include:
  - ""Can you provide examples of smells used in different artistic mediums?""
  - ""What are common examples of smells associated with specific emotions or experiences?""

In summary, the manual list may benefit from including questions that delve deeper into the properties, associations, contexts, and examples of smells, as these aspects are highlighted in the generated questions but are not adequately represented in the manual list.",0.5600145697593689,Which smells are frequently present in paintings but not in texts?,What is the thing to which the smell was applied?; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?,0.19000712037086487,0.6156893968582153,"[0.5198879241943359, 0.08397801965475082, 0.11601553112268448, 0.1147209033370018, 0.11543326824903488]",0.0,,0,0.5198879241943359,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 4.0}, {'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 2, 'Average': 3.0}]"

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that have not been matched with any manual CQs based on the similarity metrics. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.20) and the fact that no matches have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

The generated CQs that have the highest cosine similarity with the manual CQs (0.53, 0.12, etc.) still indicate a lack of strong alignment overall. The following generated CQs could be considered essential and potentially missing from the manual list:

1. **""What is the thing to which the smell was applied?""**  
   This question addresses the application of smell, which may be a relevant aspect of the topic that is not covered in the manual list.

2. **""; What does the property od:F1_generated associate an instance of L2 Stimulus Generation with?""**  
   This CQ focuses on the relationship between properties and instances, which could be crucial for understanding the underlying data model.

3. **""; What is the comment associated with the property od:F1_generated?""**  
   This question seeks to understand the commentary or metadata associated with a specific property, which may be important for contextualizing the data.

4. **""; What is the range of the property od:F1_generated?""**  
   Understanding the range of a property is essential for grasping the limits and applicability of the data, which may be a significant oversight in the manual list.

5. **""; What are some examples of how the property od:F10_targeted is used?""**

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated competency questions (CQs) and their corresponding manual counterparts, several essential CQs appear to be missing from the manual list. Here are some observations:

- **Data Analysis:** The generated CQ ""; How was the data analyzed in the requirements engineering survey?"" addresses the specific methods and processes used to analyze data, which is crucial for understanding the validity and reliability of the survey results. This aspect is not explicitly covered in the manual questions.

- **Methodologies Used:** The generated CQ ""; What methodologies were used in the requirements engineering survey?"" highlights the importance of understanding the research design and methodologies employed in the survey. While the manual does touch on empirical methods, it does not directly ask about the methodologies used in the survey context.

- **Objectives of the Survey:** The generated CQ ""What are the main objectives of the requirements engineering survey?"" is essential for clarifying the purpose and goals of the survey. Although the manual questions discuss definitions and justifications, they do not explicitly inquire about the survey's objectives.

- **Key Findings:** The generated CQ ""; What were the key findings of the requirements engineering survey?"" is critical for summarizing the outcomes and insights derived from the survey. The manual question about synthesizing results does not directly address the specific findings of the survey.

In summary, the manual list lacks specific inquiries regarding the data analysis methods, methodologies used, objectives of the survey, and key findings, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the requirements engineering survey. These missing CQs could enhance the depth and clarity of the manual's coverage of the topic.",0.625760242226836,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the analysis of the generated competency questions (CQs) and the manual list, it appears that the generated CQs primarily focus on the limitations of accessing external content and the need for specific data to generate relevant questions. This indicates a lack of substantive content in the generated CQs that could be considered essential for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

**Missing Essential CQs:**

1. **Contextual Understanding of SE Research:** The generated CQs do not address the specific aspects of Software Engineering (SE) research, such as methodologies, trends, or challenges faced in the field. Essential questions could include:
   - ""What are the current trends in Software Engineering research?""
   - ""What methodologies are commonly used in empirical studies of Software Engineering?""

2. **Impact and Application of Research:** There is a lack of questions that explore the impact of SE research on industry practices or its applicability. Essential questions could include:
   - ""How do findings from SE research influence industry practices?""
   - ""What are the barriers to implementing SE research findings in real-world applications?""

3. **Comparative Analysis:** The generated CQs do not include comparative questions that could provide insights into the effectiveness of different approaches or technologies in SE. Essential questions could include:
   - ""How do different software development methodologies compare in terms of efficiency and effectiveness?""
   - ""What are the differences in outcomes between traditional and agile software development practices?""

4. **Stakeholder Perspectives:** The generated CQs do not consider the perspectives of various stakeholders involved in SE research, such as practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. Essential questions could include:
   - ""What are the perspectives of industry practitioners on the relevance of SE research?""
   - ""How do policymakers perceive the impact of SE research on technology regulation?""

In summary, the generated CQs are largely generic and do not capture the specific nuances and critical areas of inquiry that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of Software Engineering research.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and purpose of the generated CQs. The generated CQ primarily focuses on the limitations of accessing external content and emphasizes the need for context to generate relevant questions. This suggests that the generated CQs are more about the process of generating questions rather than the substantive content of software engineering (SE) research.

Based on this analysis, the following essential CQs could be considered missing from the manual list:

1. **Contextual Understanding of SE Research:**
   - ""What are the key challenges faced by researchers in accessing and utilizing digital libraries for SE research?""
   - ""How do researchers ensure the reliability and validity of the information retrieved from electronic resources?""

2. **Publication Channels and Accessibility:**
   - ""What alternative publication channels do authors utilize to disseminate their SE research findings?""
   - ""How do authors ensure that their research is accessible to various stakeholders, including practitioners and policymakers?""

3. **Synthesis and Presentation of Results:**
   - ""In what ways do authors present their findings to enhance usability for industrial users?""
   - ""What formats (e.g., guidelines, checklists) are most effective for communicating SE research results to practitioners?""

4. **Trends and Coverage in SE Research:**
   - ""What trends can be observed in the sub-fields of SE and RE over the past decade?""
   - ""How do empirical studies in SE research evolve in response to industry needs?""

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential competency questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to analyze the content and intent of the generated questions compared to the manual questions. 

The generated question primarily focuses on the inability to access external content and offers assistance in generating competency questions based on provided information. This indicates a lack of specificity and relevance to the actual content of software engineering (SE) research or related fields.

**Missing Essential CQs:**
1. **Contextual Understanding of SE Research:**
   - Questions that directly address the specific methodologies, findings, or implications of SE research are missing. For example:
     - ""What methodologies are commonly used in SE research to evaluate software quality?""
     - ""What are the key findings from recent empirical studies in SE?""

2. **User-Centric Questions:**
   - Questions that focus on the needs of specific user groups (e.g., practitioners, policy-makers) in relation to SE research are not present. For example:
     - ""How do the findings of SE research impact software development practices in industry?""
     - ""What guidelines can be derived from SE research for practitioners in the field?""

3. **Trends and Evolution in SE:**
   - Questions that explore trends over time in SE research or the evolution of specific sub-fields are also missing. For example:
     - ""How has the focus of SE research shifted over the past decade?""
     - ""What emerging trends are being observed in SE and RE research?""

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Questions that compare different approaches or findings within SE research are absent. For example:
     - ""How do different software development methodologies compare in terms of effectiveness?""

"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pairs with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) are as follows:

1. **Generated:** ""What are the main findings of the study?""  
   **Manual:** ""Do the authors report the selected context of their study with specific characteristics?""  
   **Cosine Similarity:** 0.68  
   **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.12  

2. **Generated:** ""Who are the authors of the research paper?""  
   **Manual:** ""How often are those who conduct the studies also the authors of the papers?""  
   **Cosine Similarity:** 0.65  
   **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.25  

3. **Generated:** ""What are the main findings of the study?""  
   **Manual:** ""How do the authors justify the lack of a proper study?""  
   **Cosine Similarity:** 0.62  
   **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.21  

4. **Generated:** ""What are the main findings of the study?""  
   **Manual:** ""Do the authors use (a common set of empirically derived) criteria to assess the quality of individual studies?""  
   **Cosine Similarity:** 0.59  
   **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.10  

5. **Generated:** ""What are the main findings of the study?""  
   **Manual:** ""How has the reporting of the objects of study / treatments evolved over time?""  
   **Cosine Similarity:** 0.57  
   **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.12  

These pairs indicate that the generated question ""What are the main findings of the study?"" is particularly similar to multiple manual questions, suggesting that it captures a central theme relevant to the study's findings.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated questions and their focus areas. The generated questions include:

- ""What are the main findings of the study?""
- ""Who are the authors of the research paper?""

From this analysis, we can infer that the following essential CQs might be missing from the manual list:

1. **Questions about the methodology:** There may be a lack of questions focusing on the specific methodologies used in the studies. For example, questions like ""What research methods were employed in the study?"" or ""How was the data collected and analyzed?"" are crucial for understanding the validity of the findings.

2. **Questions regarding the implications of findings:** While the generated questions touch on findings, there may be a need for questions that explore the implications of those findings. For instance, ""What are the implications of the study's findings for future research?"" or ""How do the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge?""

3. **Questions about limitations:** Questions addressing the limitations of the studies are also essential. For example, ""What limitations did the authors acknowledge in their study?"" or ""How might the study's limitations affect the interpretation of the findings?""

4. **Questions about the context of the study:** While one of the manual questions touches on context, more specific questions could be beneficial, such as ""What is the context in which the study was conducted?"" or ""How does the context influence the study's findings?""

5. **Questions about the target population:** Understanding the target population is critical. Questions like ""Who were the participants in the study?"" or ""What criteria were used to select the study population?"" could provide valuable insights.

In summary, while the manual list contains relevant questions, it may benefit from additional questions that cover methodology, implications, limitations, context, and target population to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the studies being analyzed.",0.6130034491613314,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?
