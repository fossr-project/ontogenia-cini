- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair represents the highest cosine similarity score among all pairs analyzed, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity in terms of vector representation, the Jaccard similarity score suggests that there are no common terms or elements between the two questions. This discrepancy highlights that while the questions may be related in a broader context (e.g., public health), they focus on different aspects of health data.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.38) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity in Disease Incidence**: The generated CQ regarding the incidence rate of Hepatitis A is specific and detailed, focusing on age groups, geographical region, and vaccination status. If the manual list lacks similar specificity regarding disease incidence rates, this could be a significant omission.
  
2. **Temporal Analysis**: The generated CQ spans a time frame (2018 to 2021), which may not be represented in the manual list. Questions that address trends over time or changes in disease incidence could be essential for comprehensive public health analysis.

3. **Demographic Variability**: The generated CQ mentions different age groups, which indicates a need for demographic considerations in the manual list. If the manual CQs do not address how disease incidence varies across different demographics, this is a critical gap.

4. **Vaccination Status**: The mention of vaccination status in the generated CQ suggests a focus on preventive health measures and their impact on disease incidence. If the manual list does not include questions about vaccination effects or status, this is another essential area that is missing.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of incidence rates based on vaccination status. If the manual list lacks questions that facilitate comparative studies, this could limit the scope of inquiry.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on specific disease incidence rates, temporal trends, demographic variability, vaccination impacts, and comparative analyses. These elements are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of public health issues and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list of CQs.",[0.3780423700809479],0.3780423700809479,How many distinct disease categories are there?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]","What is the incidence rate of Hepatitis A per 100,000 population for different age groups in the Lombardy region from 2018 to 2021, and how does it vary by vaccination status?",0.3780423700809479,0.543542742729187
0.5847538113594055,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What is the incidence rate of Hepatitis A per 100,000 population in the Lombardy region for different age groups from 2018 to 2021?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which codes correspond to each disease category?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.35** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely related in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is quite low, indicating minimal shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically look for the following:

- **Coverage of Topics**: The generated CQs should cover a wide range of topics relevant to the domain of interest. If the manual list lacks questions that address specific areas of concern or interest, those would be considered missing.
  
- **Variability in Question Types**: Essential CQs should include various types of questions, such as those asking for definitions, comparisons, statistics, and relationships. If the manual list is skewed towards one type of question, it may miss essential inquiries.

- **Specificity and Detail**: The generated CQs often contain specific details (e.g., time frames, demographic groups) that may not be present in the manual list. If the manual list lacks specificity, it may miss critical questions that could provide valuable insights.

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average similarities across various metrics (e.g., Jaccard similarity of 0.04, BLEU score of 0.01), it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be a significant number of essential questions that are not represented in the manual list.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs against the manual list, looking for unique topics, question types, and details that are present in the generated set but absent in the manual set. Without the actual content of the manual list, it is not possible to enumerate the specific missing questions, but the analysis suggests that there are likely several essential CQs that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list may be lacking in coverage, variability, and specificity, which are critical for a robust set of competency questions.",[0.34928181767463684],0.34928181767463684,Which codes correspond to each disease category?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 5.0}]","What is the incidence rate of Hepatitis A per 100,000 population in the Lombardy region for different age groups from 2018 to 2021?",0.34928181767463684,0.5847538113594055

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.58**, which is the maximum score recorded for all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.09**, indicating that while the two questions share some common elements, they are still quite different in terms of their specific wording and structure. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the generated CQ focuses on specific metrics (average length of hospital stays) and a defined time frame (2012 to 2018) within a specific region (Lombardy), it suggests a need for more detailed and context-specific questions in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs:**

1. **Temporal Analysis of Hospitalization Rates**: Questions that explore how hospitalization rates for specific diseases have changed over time, similar to the generated CQ, could be essential. For example:
   - ""What trends have been observed in hospitalization rates for infectious diseases in Lombardy from 2012 to 2018?""

2. **Regional Comparisons**: Questions that compare hospitalization rates or lengths of stay across different regions or demographics could provide valuable insights. For example:
   - ""How do hospitalization rates for infectious diseases in Lombardy compare to those in other ATS regions?""

3. **Specific Disease Focus**: Questions that focus on particular diseases or conditions, rather than general categories, could be missing. For example:
   - ""What is the average length of hospital stays for patients diagnosed with malaria in Lombardy from 2012 to 2018?""

4. **Impact of External Factors**: Questions that investigate the impact of external factors (e.g., public health interventions, seasonal outbreaks) on hospitalization rates could also be relevant. For example:
   - ""How did public health campaigns affect hospitalization rates for infectious diseases in Lombardy during the specified period?""

5. **Demographic Factors**: Questions that consider demographic factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status) in relation to hospitalization rates could provide a more comprehensive understanding. For example:
   - ""What demographic factors influence the length of hospital stays for infectious diseases in Lombardy?""

In summary, the manual list may benefit from including more specific, context-driven questions that address trends, comparisons, and factors influencing hospitalization rates, particularly in relation to infectious diseases in Lombardy. This would enhance the comprehensiveness and relevance of the competency questions.",[0.5795583724975586],0.5795583724975586,When is the rate of hospitalisation related to a disease registered? ,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",How has the average length of hospital stays for infectious and parasitic diseases changed across different ATS regions in Lombardy from 2012 to 2018?,0.5795583724975586,0.6539037823677063

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given that the generated CQs have a high average cosine similarity (0.69) with the manual CQs, it suggests that the generated CQs are likely addressing similar themes or topics. However, the following aspects should be considered to identify potential gaps:

- **Broader Scope**: The generated CQ regarding the average length of hospital stay for infectious and parasitic diseases across different health structures in Lombardy from 2012 to 2018 indicates a focus on comparative analysis over time and across different health structures. If the manual list lacks questions that address temporal comparisons or cross-structural analyses, this could be a significant gap.

- **Specific Disease Categories**: The generated CQ emphasizes infectious and parasitic diseases specifically. If the manual list does not include questions that focus on specific disease categories or their impact on hospital stay lengths, this could represent an essential area that is missing.

- **Geographical Context**: The generated CQ specifies the Lombardy Region, which may imply that the manual list lacks questions that consider geographical variations in healthcare metrics. If the manual list does not include questions that explore regional differences in hospital stays or healthcare outcomes, this could be another missing element.

- **Temporal Analysis**: The generated CQ spans a specific time frame (2012 to 2018). If the manual list does not include questions that consider changes over time or trends in hospital stays, this could indicate a lack of temporal analysis in the manual CQs.

In summary, essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list could include:
- Questions focusing on comparative analyses of hospital stays across different disease categories and health structures.
- Questions that explore geographical variations in healthcare metrics.
- Questions that consider temporal trends in hospital stays and healthcare outcomes.

Identifying these gaps can help ensure that the manual list of CQs is comprehensive and addresses a wide range of relevant topics in healthcare analytics.",[0.6938816905021667],0.6938816905021667,Which hospital has the longest average length of stay for a particular disease category?,1.0,1,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",How does the average length of hospital stay for infectious and parasitic diseases compare across different health structures in Lombardy Region from 2012 to 2018?,0.6938816905021667,0.7121166586875916

- **Focus on Specific Metrics**: The generated CQs seem to emphasize specific metrics related to hospital stays, disease categories, and time frames (e.g., ""average length of hospital stays for infectious and parasitic diseases""). If the manual list lacks questions that address these specific metrics, they would be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Temporal Analysis**: The generated CQ mentions a time frame (2012 to 2018), which suggests a need for temporal analysis in the manual list. If the manual CQs do not include questions that explore changes over time or trends, these would be essential missing elements.

- **Health Structure Variability**: The generated CQ references ""different health structures,"" indicating a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that explore variations across different healthcare facilities or systems. If the manual list does not include questions that address this variability, they would be essential missing CQs.

In summary, essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list include:

1. Questions focusing on specific metrics related to hospital stays and disease categories.
2. Questions that analyze trends or changes over specific time periods.
3. Questions that explore differences across various health structures or facilities.

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.30, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.03 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual content or vocabulary used in the two questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity across all pairs, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity in Data Analysis**: The generated CQ regarding the concentration of nitrates in water samples indicates a focus on specific pollutants and their variations across municipalities. If the manual list lacks questions that address specific pollutants or their concentrations, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Temporal Analysis**: The generated CQ mentions a specific year (2020) and implies a temporal analysis of data. If the manual list does not include questions that explore how measurements change over time or across different time periods, this could be another missing aspect.

3. **Geographical Context**: The generated CQ specifies monitoring across different municipalities, which suggests a geographical dimension to the analysis. If the manual list does not include questions that consider geographical variations or comparisons, this could be an essential area that is overlooked.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of data across municipalities. If the manual list lacks questions that encourage comparisons between different locations or datasets, this could be a critical omission.

5. **Focus on Monitoring Points**: The manual CQ mentions monitoring points but does not specify the types of measurements or parameters being monitored. If the generated CQs include specific parameters (like nitrates) that are not addressed in the manual, this could indicate a missing focus on the types of data collected.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on specific pollutants, temporal changes, geographical comparisons, and detailed monitoring parameters. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions and ensure a more thorough exploration of the subject matter.",[0.3006894588470459],0.3006894588470459,"What physical parameters have been recorded at each monitoring point, and how do these measurements vary over time?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",How does the concentration of nitrates in water samples vary across different municipalities monitored by the ATS della Città Metropolitana di Milano in 2020?,0.3006894588470459,0.6148572564125061

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics and the nature of the questions, we can infer the following potential gaps:

- **Specificity of Data**: The generated CQ regarding ""average levels of nitrates"" suggests a focus on quantitative analysis and specific data points over time (in this case, the year 2020). If the manual list lacks questions that specifically address quantitative measurements or trends over time, this could be a significant gap.

- **Temporal Aspects**: The generated CQ explicitly mentions a time frame (the year 2020). If the manual list does not include questions that consider temporal changes or trends in water quality parameters, this could be an essential area that is missing.

- **Geographical Context**: The generated CQ refers to ""different municipalities,"" indicating a geographical aspect that may not be covered in the manual list. If the manual CQs do not address geographical variations in water quality or monitoring sites, this could represent another missing element.

- **Parameter Specificity**: The manual CQ mentions ""a specified water quality parameter,"" which is somewhat vague. If the generated CQs include specific parameters (like nitrates, phosphates, etc.) that are not represented in the manual list, this could indicate a lack of specificity in the manual CQs.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list could include:
- Questions focusing on specific quantitative measurements and trends over time.
- Questions that address geographical variations in water quality.
- Questions that specify particular water quality parameters rather than general terms.

To fully assess the missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the content and focus of both sets of questions would be necessary, ideally involving a qualitative analysis of the themes and topics covered in each set.",[0.5257967710494995],0.5257967710494995,"For a specified water quality parameter, which monitoring sites registered the observation, and when were these measurements recorded?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the average levels of nitrates measured in water samples across different municipalities in the year 2020?,0.5257967710494995,0.6215567588806152

- The purpose of specific ontology terms (e.g., BFO 0000007).
- The status of classes (e.g., deprecated classes).
- Relationships between ontology terms (e.g., IAO 0000025 and IAO 0000027).
- Characteristics of specific classes (e.g., Class 6).
- Usage of specific identifiers in conjunction (e.g., N038a78109df84aeb979591f078766572 with N0aa5e0c6bc024212a1642af158273caf).

Given the nature of these questions, the following essential CQs may be missing from the manual list:

1. **Purpose of Specific Ontology Terms:** Questions that ask about the purpose or role of specific terms within the ontology (e.g., ""What is the purpose of [specific term]?"").
  
2. **Status of Classes:** Questions regarding which classes are deprecated or active within the ontology (e.g., ""Which classes are deprecated in [ontology name]?"").

3. **Relationships Between Terms:** Questions that explore how different terms relate to one another (e.g., ""How is [term A] related to [term B]?"").

4. **Characteristics of Classes:** Questions that inquire about the defining features or characteristics of specific classes (e.g., ""What are the defining characteristics of [class name]?"").

5. **Usage of Identifiers:** Questions that ask about the compatibility or usage of specific identifiers in conjunction (e.g., ""Can [identifier A] be used with [identifier B]?"").

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that while there are some pairs with relatively higher similarity, the overall similarity metrics suggest a significant gap between the generated and manual CQs.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Based on the generated CQs, several essential competency questions appear to be missing from the manual list. Here are some observations:

- **Specificity to Ontology Classes:** The generated CQs focus on specific ontology classes (e.g., ""IAO 0000025"", ""BFO 0000007"", ""N054b4a0d4c684b7490df0b60662507b9""). These questions are crucial for understanding the relationships and functionalities of specific entities within the ontology. The manual list does not seem to address these specific inquiries, which are essential for users looking to navigate or utilize the ontology effectively.

- **Deprecation and Subclass Queries:** The generated question ""Which classes are deprecated in the ontology?"" is significant for users who need to maintain or update systems based on the ontology. Similarly, the question about subclasses (""Are there any subclasses of N0b4b780f77384ebdaef4039760a352b9?"") is vital for understanding the hierarchy and relationships within the ontology. The absence of such questions in the manual list indicates a gap in addressing the structural and maintenance aspects of the ontology.

- **Purpose and Functionality:** The question ""What is the purpose of BFO 0000007 in the ontology?"" highlights the need for clarity on the roles and functions of specific classes. This type of inquiry is essential for users who need to understand the rationale behind the ontology's design and its components.

0.6515938639640808,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key activities and their associated time durations recorded for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What data are collected for FAB?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.32
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.15

This indicates that while there is some level of similarity between the generated and manual CQs, it is relatively low, as evidenced by the maximum cosine similarity across all pairs being 0.32. This suggests that the generated and manual questions may share some thematic elements but differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for unique themes, concepts, or questions that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs beyond the highest similarity pair is not provided, we can infer the following based on the statistics:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.32 and the average Jaccard similarity of 0.15 indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. This suggests that there may be several important questions or themes present in the generated set that are not captured in the manual set.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This further emphasizes that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list, as no generated questions are deemed sufficiently similar to warrant a match.

To identify specific missing CQs, one would need to conduct a qualitative analysis of the generated CQs to extract key themes or questions that are not represented in the manual list. This could involve looking for questions related to:
- Specific data types or metrics not mentioned in the manual.
- Unique aspects of the DemCare dataset that are not addressed in the manual CQs.
- Broader or more detailed inquiries about patient activities, outcomes, or data collection processes that may be relevant to the context but are absent from the manual.

In summary, while we cannot pinpoint exact missing CQs without additional context, the analysis suggests that there are likely several essential questions related to the dataset and its usage that are not captured in the manual list, given the low similarity scores and lack of high-precision matches.",[0.3227730989456177],0.3227730989456177,What data are collected for FAB,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated time durations recorded for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.3227730989456177,0.6515938639640808

The analysis indicates that the pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is as follows:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key activities and their associated timeframes for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What data are collected for the trail making test?""

**Similarity Scores**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.30
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.20

This pair represents the highest similarity across all evaluated pairs, with both the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores being relatively low, indicating that while there is some overlap in the content or structure of the questions, they are not closely aligned in terms of semantic meaning.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.30) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Activities and Timeframes**: The generated CQ about ""key activities and their associated timeframes"" suggests a focus on the temporal aspect of patient data, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This could indicate a gap in understanding how activities are tracked over time in the context of the DemCare dataset.

2. **Patient-Centric Questions**: The generated CQs may include questions that are more patient-centric, focusing on individual patient experiences or outcomes, which might not be captured in the manual list that appears to focus more on specific tests or data collection methods.

3. **Data Utilization and Analysis**: Questions regarding how the collected data is utilized for analysis or decision-making processes may also be missing. For instance, inquiries about how the data from the trail making test is used to assess cognitive function or inform treatment plans could be essential.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Generated CQs might also include comparative questions, such as how different tests or datasets relate to each other, which could provide insights into the broader context of the research or clinical application.

In summary, the manual list may lack CQs that address the temporal dynamics of patient data, patient-centric perspectives, the application of collected data, and comparative analyses, all of which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Further exploration of the generated CQs could help identify specific questions that fill these gaps.",[0.2991400361061096],0.2991400361061096,What data are collected for the trail making test?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What are the key activities and their associated timeframes for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.2991400361061096,0.6358970403671265

The cosine similarity score of 0.40 suggests that there is some overlap in the vector representations of the two questions, while the Jaccard similarity score of 0.19 indicates a lower degree of shared elements when considering the unique terms in each question.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Key Observations**:
- The average cosine similarity of 0.40 and the maximum of 0.40 indicate that while there is some similarity, it is not strong enough to suggest that the generated CQs are effectively capturing the same concepts as the manual CQs.
- The average Jaccard similarity of 0.19 further supports the idea that the overlap in terms is minimal.
- The average BLEU score of 0.02 and the average ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.31 indicate that the generated CQs are not closely matching the phrasing or structure of the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While the specific content of the manual CQs is not provided, we can infer that essential CQs that might be missing could include:

- Questions that focus on specific metrics or outcomes related to the DemCare dataset that are not addressed in the generated CQs.
- CQs that inquire about the methodology or processes used in data collection or analysis that are critical for understanding the context of the dataset.
- Questions that explore relationships between different variables within the dataset, which may not be captured by the generated CQs.

In summary, the generated CQs appear to lack depth and specificity compared to the manual CQs, indicating that essential questions related to the dataset's context, methodology, and variable relationships may be missing from the manual list. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the objectives of the dataset would be necessary to identify specific missing questions.",[0.39954185485839844],0.39954185485839844,What data are collected for the short cognitive battery test?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.39954185485839844,0.6553925275802612
0.6311874389648438,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""

This pair represents the highest similarity across all metrics provided. However, it is important to note that while the cosine similarity is relatively low (0.31), it is the maximum observed in this analysis. The Jaccard similarity is also very low (0.04), indicating that the overlap in terms of unique terms between the two questions is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can infer from the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity is low (0.31) and there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- The generated CQs likely cover specific aspects or details that are not addressed in the manual list. For instance, the generated CQ about ""key activities and their associated durations"" suggests a focus on temporal aspects of patient care, which may not be present in the manual list.
- Additionally, if the generated CQs include questions about specific datasets (like the DemCare dataset), methodologies, or detailed processes that are not reflected in the manual CQs, these could be considered essential missing questions.

**Conclusion**:
To identify the exact missing CQs, a thorough comparison of the content and themes of both sets would be necessary. However, based on the provided statistics, it is clear that the generated CQs introduce new dimensions or details that are not captured in the manual list, particularly regarding patient activities, durations, and possibly dataset-specific inquiries. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some similarity between the generated and manual CQs, the overall alignment is weak, suggesting that the manual list may benefit from incorporating additional questions that reflect the nuances present in the generated set.",[0.3056560158729553],0.3056560158729553,What types of steps does ecological assessment consist of?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.3056560158729553,0.6510202884674072

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, it appears that the generated CQs do not align well with the manual CQs, as indicated by the low similarity scores across various metrics. The following points can be inferred regarding essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list:

- **Domain-Specific Focus**: The generated CQ about dementia and the DemCare dataset suggests a focus on specific health-related factors. If the manual list lacks questions addressing health data, patient progression, or specific datasets, these could be considered essential missing CQs.

- **Depth of Inquiry**: The generated CQs seem to delve into the factors influencing dementia progression, which indicates a need for more in-depth questions in the manual list. If the manual list primarily contains surface-level or general questions (like ""Which are the free discussion tasks?""), it may miss out on critical inquiries that require deeper analysis or understanding of the subject matter.

- **Contextual Relevance**: The generated CQs may also include context-specific questions that are relevant to the dataset or research area being explored. If the manual list does not include questions that are contextually relevant to the DemCare dataset or similar datasets, these would be essential additions.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that focus on specific factors related to dementia, inquiries that require deeper analysis, and contextually relevant questions that align with the generated CQs. This gap indicates a need for a more comprehensive set of CQs that cover various aspects of the subject matter.",[0.07465705275535583],0.07465705275535583,Which are the free discussion tasks?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the key factors influencing the progression of dementia in patients within the DemCare dataset?,0.07465705275535583,0.6170823574066162

1. **Specificity in Patient Activities**: The generated CQ about ""key activities and their associated durations"" indicates a focus on specific patient activities and their temporal aspects, which may not be captured in the manual list.
2. **Quantitative Aspects**: The mention of ""durations"" in the generated CQ suggests a quantitative analysis of activities, which may be an essential aspect that is not addressed in the manual CQs.
3. **Dataset Context**: The reference to the ""DemCare dataset"" in the generated CQ implies a context-specific inquiry that may not be reflected in the more general manual questions about clinical interest and social interaction.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the themes of the generated and manual CQs, the generated CQs introduce specific aspects related to patient activities and quantitative measures that may be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain. Therefore, it is recommended to review the generated CQs for additional insights and to consider incorporating them into the manual list to enhance its completeness and relevance.",[0.35327237844467163],0.35327237844467163,What activities (situations) are of clinical interest with respect to social interaction?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.35327237844467163,0.6590214371681213

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What social interaction related situations indicate a problem or possibly problematic behaviour that needs to be highlighted to the clinician?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.23** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.06**. The cosine similarity indicates a low level of semantic similarity between the two questions, suggesting that while they may share some thematic elements, they are fundamentally different in focus and intent. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is quite low, indicating minimal overlap in the sets of words used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest being 0.23), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter that are not represented in the manual list.

Some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing from the manual list could include:

- **Specific Data Analysis**: The generated CQ about ""key activities and their associated durations"" indicates a focus on data analysis and metrics related to patient activities, which may not be addressed in the manual list.
  
- **Temporal Aspects**: The mention of ""durations"" in the generated CQ suggests a temporal dimension that may be absent in the manual questions, which could be crucial for understanding patient care timelines.

- **Patient-Centric Queries**: The generated CQ emphasizes patient-specific information, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list, particularly if the manual questions are more general or clinician-focused.

- **Operational Insights**: The generated CQ hints at operational insights regarding patient management in the DemCare dataset, which may not be captured in the manual questions that focus on social interactions or behavioral issues.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on specific data metrics, temporal aspects of patient care, and operational insights related to patient activities, which are critical for a comprehensive understanding of the domain. Further analysis of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific questions that are not represented in the manual list.",[0.2281404435634613],0.2281404435634613,What social interaction related situations indicate a problem or possibly problematic behaviour that needs to be highlighted to the clinician?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.2281404435634613,0.6176160573959351

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.40
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.12

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.40, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.12 suggests that there is a low overlap in the unique terms used in both questions, which is consistent with the nature of the questions being related but not identical.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover aspects that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Patient-Centric Activities**: The generated CQ emphasizes ""key activities and their associated time durations for each patient,"" which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This focus on patient-specific data and time durations could be crucial for understanding patient engagement and activity tracking in the context of the DemCare dataset.

2. **Quantitative Aspects of Activities**: The mention of ""time durations"" in the generated CQ indicates a quantitative aspect of activities that may be missing from the manual list. This could be essential for analyses related to the frequency and duration of activities, which are important for clinical assessments.

3. **Dataset-Specific Queries**: The generated CQ references the ""DemCare dataset,"" which suggests a need for questions that are specific to the dataset being analyzed. If the manual list does not include questions that pertain to the specific context or data structure of the DemCare dataset, this could represent a significant gap.

4. **Comparative or Trend Analysis**: If the generated CQs include questions that allow for comparisons over time or between different patient groups, and these are not reflected in the manual list, they would be essential for comprehensive analysis.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely revolve around patient-specific activities, quantitative measures of those activities, dataset-specific inquiries, and comparative analyses that are crucial for a thorough understanding of the data and its implications in a clinical context.",[0.39583125710487366],0.39583125710487366,What activities (situations) are of clinical interest with respect to physical activity?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated time durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.39583125710487366,0.6500071883201599

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.36
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.06

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.36, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.06 suggests that there is a very low overlap in the actual words used in both questions, which may imply that while the questions are related in context, they differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Types of Care Activities**: The generated CQ about ""different types of care activities recorded in the DemCare dataset"" indicates a focus on categorization and specifics of care activities, which may not be addressed in the manual list.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare different types of care activities or their effectiveness may not be present in the manual list.
4. **Patient-Centric Queries**: Questions that focus on patient outcomes or experiences related to care activities could also be lacking.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the generated and manual CQs, the low similarity scores suggest that the manual list may not comprehensively cover all relevant aspects of the topic. The generated CQs appear to introduce new dimensions that could enhance the understanding of care activities in the context of the DemCare dataset. Therefore, it would be beneficial to review the generated CQs in detail to identify and incorporate any essential questions that are currently missing from the manual list.",[0.36045339703559875],0.36045339703559875,What information is clinically relevant for walking?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the different types of care activities recorded in the DemCare dataset?,0.36045339703559875,0.6340473890304565

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision (0.00) for matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that there are no generated CQs that closely align with the manual CQs in terms of semantic similarity.

**Key Observations**:
- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is relatively low (0.42), suggesting that the generated CQs do not closely match the manual CQs.
- The absence of any matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher indicates that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While specific missing CQs cannot be identified without the complete list of manual CQs, we can infer that the generated CQs may include questions that address:
- Specific metrics or outcomes related to physical activity that are not captured in the manual list.
- Detailed inquiries about the data collection process, such as how activities are recorded or the context in which they are assessed.
- Questions that explore the implications of the data on patient care or outcomes, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual CQs.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to specific details about the data, its collection, and its implications for clinical practice, which are represented in the generated CQs but not in the manual ones.

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What physical activity related situations indicate a problem or possibly problematic behaviour that needs to be highlighted to the clinician?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.31** and a Jaccard similarity score of **0.06**. The cosine similarity score indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions, while the Jaccard similarity score, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is quite low, suggesting that while the questions may be related in context, they differ significantly in their specific wording and terminology.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to compare the generated CQs against the manual CQs to identify any that are present in the generated set but absent in the manual set. However, since the specific lists of generated and manual CQs are not provided in your query, I can outline a general approach to identify missing CQs:

- **Comparison of Topics**: Review the topics covered in the generated CQs and compare them with those in the manual CQs. Look for areas that are addressed in the generated set but not in the manual set.
  
- **Semantic Coverage**: Analyze the semantic content of the generated CQs to identify any key themes or questions that are not represented in the manual list. This could include specific aspects of the dataset, patient activities, or clinical indicators that are not explicitly mentioned in the manual CQs.

- **Domain Relevance**: Consider the domain of the CQs (in this case, related to patient care and activities) and identify any critical questions that would be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the domain but are missing from the manual list.

Without the actual lists of generated and manual CQs, I cannot provide specific missing questions. However, if you can provide those lists, I would be able to conduct a more detailed analysis and identify the essential CQs that are missing from the manual list.",[0.308279812335968],0.308279812335968,What physical activity related situations indicate a problem or possibly problematic behaviour that needs to be highlighted to the clinician?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the key activities and their associated durations for each patient in the DemCare dataset?,0.308279812335968,0.6241776943206787

- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the main types of entities?""

Both the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity for this pair are 0.36, which is the maximum value recorded for all pairs. This indicates that while there is some overlap in the concepts being queried, the similarity is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is 0.36, and the maximum is also 0.36, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

Since the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, it suggests that none of the generated CQs have a strong enough similarity to be considered a match with the manual CQs. This implies that there are likely several essential CQs that are present in the generated list but not represented in the manual list.

To identify the specific missing CQs, one would typically need to compare the content of the generated CQs against the manual CQs. However, since the statistics indicate a lack of strong matches, we can infer that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not addressed in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs** could include:
- Questions that explore specific attributes or characteristics of the entities in the dataset.
- Inquiries about relationships between different types of care activities or entities.
- Questions that delve into the context or application of the data within the DemCare dataset.

In summary, while the exact missing CQs cannot be identified without the full list of generated and manual CQs, the analysis indicates that the generated CQs likely encompass important aspects of the domain that are not captured in the manual list, highlighting a gap in the coverage of essential questions.",[0.362101286649704],0.362101286649704,What are the main types of entities?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 5, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the different types of care activities recorded in the DemCare dataset?,0.362101286649704,0.7578855752944946

- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.13
- **Jaccard Similarity:** 0.13

These scores indicate that while there is some level of similarity, it is relatively low, suggesting that the content and focus of the questions differ significantly. The maximum and average values for cosine and Jaccard similarity across all pairs are also 0.13, indicating that this is the only pair that stands out in terms of similarity.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the maximum cosine similarity is only 0.13, it suggests that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs, indicating potential gaps in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
- The generated CQ regarding ""key activities and their associated timeframes for each care plan"" suggests a focus on operational details within the DemCare dataset, which may not be covered in the manual list. This indicates a potential gap in the manual regarding the specifics of care plans and their implementation.
- If the generated CQs include questions about specific metrics, outcomes, or processes related to care plans, these may also be missing from the manual list, as the manual CQ provided focuses on broader categories rather than specific operational details.

**Conclusion:**
To identify the essential CQs that are missing, a thorough review of the generated CQs should be conducted to pinpoint specific topics or areas of inquiry that are not represented in the manual list.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the domain that are not addressed by the manual CQs.

**Key Observations:**
- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific data attributes and relationships (e.g., activities, durations, and patient data in the DemCare dataset), which may not be captured by the more general manual CQs (e.g., ""What are the main types of objects?"").
- The absence of specific questions related to data analysis, patient care, or operational metrics in the manual list suggests that these areas are underrepresented.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
1. Questions related to patient demographics, such as ""What are the demographic characteristics of patients in the DemCare dataset?""
2. Questions about data quality or completeness, such as ""How complete is the data for each patient in the DemCare dataset?""
3. Questions regarding the relationships between different data points, such as ""How do key activities correlate with patient outcomes in the DemCare dataset?""
4. Questions about temporal aspects, such as ""What are the trends in patient activities over time in the DemCare dataset?""

If the manual list does not include questions that explore the nature of materials or sources related to sensory experiences, this could represent another gap.

- **Quantitative Aspects**: The manual CQ about ""the highest number of documentation"" implies a quantitative analysis of sources. If the generated CQs include questions that seek to quantify or compare sensory stimuli or their sources, and these are not reflected in the manual list, this could indicate a missing dimension.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the highest similarity pair is between a generated CQ about sensory stimuli and a manual CQ about smell sources, both of which show low similarity scores. Additionally, there may be essential CQs missing from the manual list, particularly those focusing on sensory experiences, event-driven inquiries, material sources, and quantitative aspects of documentation. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list of CQs.",[0.3126670718193054],0.3126670718193054,What smell sources have the highest number of documentation in the past?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.3126670718193054,0.5564875602722168

However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.03 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual content or terms used in the two questions. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be related conceptually, they differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list. Questions that explore various types of sensory stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) and their origins could be essential.
  
2. **Temporal Context**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which implies a historical or temporal context that may not be present in the manual list. Questions that address how sensory stimuli have evolved over time or their documentation in different historical periods could be valuable.

3. **Material Sources or Carriers**: The mention of ""material sources or carriers"" in the generated CQ suggests a focus on the physical or material aspects of sensory stimuli. Questions that investigate the materials or mediums through which sensory experiences are conveyed could be missing.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of different sensory stimuli and their sources. Questions that ask for comparisons between different types of stimuli or their effectiveness in various contexts may not be represented.

5. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at interdisciplinary connections (e.g., psychology, sensory studies, material culture). Questions that explore these connections or the implications of sensory stimuli in various fields could be essential.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in questions that address the broader context of sensory stimuli, their historical evolution, material sources, and interdisciplinary connections. Expanding the manual list to include these aspects could enhance its comprehensiveness and relevance.",[0.3227648437023163],0.3227648437023163,"What smell source have the highest number of documentation in [time, e.g. 18th centuries]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.3227648437023163,0.5165030360221863

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low average similarity scores across various metrics (e.g., average cosine similarity of 0.32, average Jaccard similarity of 0.03), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes the generation of sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. Questions focusing on the types of sensory stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory) and their specific contexts could be essential.
  
2. **Temporal Context**: The manual CQ mentions the timing of when a specific odour is mentioned, but there may be other temporal aspects related to sensory stimuli that are not captured. Questions about the duration or frequency of sensory experiences could be relevant.

3. **Source Material**: The generated CQ refers to the ""material substantial"" as the source of stimuli. This aspect may not be adequately addressed in the manual list, suggesting a need for questions that explore the origins or materials associated with sensory stimuli.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparison between different sensory stimuli or events. Questions that ask for comparisons or contrasts between different types of stimuli or their effects may be missing.

5. **Impact on Perception**: Questions that delve into how specific stimuli affect perception or behavior could also be essential but are not represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating questions that explore the specificity, context, and impact of sensory stimuli, as well as comparative analyses that are suggested by the generated CQs. This would provide a more comprehensive set of competency questions that cover the topic more thoroughly.",[0.3191039562225342],0.3191039562225342,When a [specific odour] started to be mentioned in text?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of these stimuli?,0.3191039562225342,0.5642390847206116

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the new odours that appeared during [specific period e.g 1800-1850]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.32** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.08**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not very similar in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is also low, indicating that the questions share very few common words.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific angles that are not represented in the manual list. For instance, if the generated CQs include questions about sensory experiences, emotional responses, or the impact of stimuli on behavior, these may not be present in the manual list.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated CQs often include specific contexts or conditions (e.g., ""during a sensory experience"" or ""specific stimulus generation event"") that may not be captured in the manual CQs. This specificity can be crucial for understanding the nuances of the subject matter.

- **Temporal and Spatial Dimensions**: The manual CQ provided focuses on a specific historical period (e.g., ""1800-1850""). If the generated CQs include questions that address different time frames or geographical contexts, these would be essential to include for a comprehensive understanding.

- **Methodological Approaches**: If the generated CQs explore different methodologies for studying sensory stimuli or experiences (e.g., experimental vs. observational studies), these would also be important to include.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely include those that address a wider range of sensory experiences, specific contexts, and methodological approaches that are not captured in the existing manual questions. A thorough review of the generated CQs would be necessary to identify specific examples of these missing questions.",[0.3186357915401459],0.3186357915401459,What are the new odours that appeared during [specific period e.g 1800-1850]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.3186357915401459,0.555047869682312

- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the new odours that appeared during [historical process e.g industrial revolution]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.41
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.12

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.41, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.12 suggests that while there is some overlap in terms of vocabulary or concepts, the overall similarity is relatively low, indicating that the questions are not identical in their focus or content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.41) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience in Cultural Heritage**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli indicates a focus on the sensory experiences associated with material substances in cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list lacks questions addressing sensory experiences, this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Material Substances and Their Impact**: The generated CQ emphasizes the relationship between specific material substances and sensory stimuli. If the manual list does not include questions about how different materials affect sensory perceptions or experiences, this could be another missing area.

3. **Historical Contexts and Sensory Changes**: The manual CQ mentions new odors during historical processes, but there may be other sensory changes (sight, sound, touch) that are not covered. Questions exploring how sensory experiences have evolved over time in relation to cultural heritage could be essential.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ suggests an interdisciplinary approach, linking sensory studies with cultural heritage. If the manual list is more focused on historical or material aspects without considering sensory studies, this could represent a missing dimension.

5. **Cultural Significance of Sensory Stimuli**: Questions that explore the cultural significance of sensory stimuli in heritage contexts may also be absent. This could include inquiries into how different cultures interpret and value sensory experiences related to their heritage.

In summary, the analysis indicates that the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address sensory experiences, the impact of material substances, historical sensory changes, interdisciplinary connections, and the cultural significance of sensory stimuli. These areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions related to cultural heritage.",[0.405215322971344],0.405215322971344,What are the new odours that appeared during [historical process e.g industrial revolution]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.405215322971344,0.672302782535553

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli encompasses a wider range of sensory experiences beyond just smell. This indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding questions that explore other senses (e.g., sight, sound, touch) in relation to specific stimuli.
  
2. **Material Sources or Carriers**: The generated CQ specifically mentions ""material sources or carriers,"" which may not be addressed in the manual list. This aspect could be crucial for understanding the context and origins of sensory experiences.

3. **Temporal Context**: The generated CQ implies a focus on specific instances of stimulus generation, which may suggest a need for questions that explore how sensory experiences change over time or in different contexts, such as seasonal variations or events.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ hints at a comparative approach (e.g., comparing different instances of stimulus generation). This could be an area that is underrepresented in the manual list, which may focus more on singular experiences rather than comparative or relational inquiries.

5. **Quantitative Aspects**: If the generated CQs include quantitative aspects (e.g., frequency of sensory experiences), this could be a missing dimension in the manual list, which may focus more on qualitative descriptions.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating questions that address a broader range of sensory experiences, the origins of stimuli, temporal changes, comparative analyses, and quantitative aspects of sensory perception. This would enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions and ensure that they cover the necessary dimensions of the subject matter.",[0.4427143633365631],0.4427143633365631,"Which smells were perceived during [recurrent part of year, e.g. spring]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.0}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific instances of stimulus generation and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.4427143633365631,0.5763388872146606
0.6240995526313782,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory experiences associated with specific odours from a cultural heritage perspective?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells were perceived during [recurrent part of day, e.g. morning]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.57**, which is the maximum score recorded for all pairs. However, it is important to note that while this score indicates some level of similarity, the Jaccard similarity score is **0.00**, suggesting that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be conceptually related, they differ significantly in their wording and structure.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for content that is not represented in the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- The average cosine similarity of **0.57** suggests that there is some overlap in the themes or topics of the generated and manual CQs, but the lack of matches with a cosine similarity of **≥ 0.6** indicates that the generated CQs may cover aspects or nuances that are not captured in the manual list.
- The **average Jaccard similarity** of **0.00** across all pairs indicates that the generated and manual CQs do not share common terms, which may imply that the manual list is missing questions that address similar themes but with different phrasing or vocabulary.
- The **average BLEU** and **ROUGE-L F1** scores of **0.00** further reinforce the idea that there are no direct matches in terms of n-grams or overlapping phrases, suggesting that the manual list may lack essential questions that could be phrased differently.

To identify specific missing essential CQs, one would need to review the generated CQs in detail and compare their themes, topics, and intents against the manual list. However, without the actual content of the generated CQs, we cannot definitively list the missing questions. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some conceptual overlap between the generated and manual CQs, the manual list may be lacking in diversity of phrasing and coverage of certain topics, which could be explored further by examining the generated CQs in detail.",[0.5747938752174377],0.5747938752174377,"Which smells were perceived during [recurrent part of day, e.g. morning]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory experiences associated with specific odours from a cultural heritage perspective?,0.5747938752174377,0.6240995526313782

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.24
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.24, indicating a low level of semantic similarity. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which further emphasizes the lack of overlap in their content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.24) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it can be inferred that the generated CQs do not closely align with the manual CQs. This indicates that there may be essential CQs that are not represented in the manual list. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQs focus on the generation of sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be adequately captured in the manual list. Questions that specifically address the types of sensory stimuli (e.g., taste, touch, sound) and their qualitative attributes could be missing.
   
2. **Comparative Analysis**: The manual CQ provided is comparative in nature, asking about the perception of two different smells. There may be a lack of questions in the manual that explore comparative sensory experiences or evaluations, which could be essential for a comprehensive understanding of sensory perception.

3. **Contextual Factors**: The generated CQs mention ""specific stimulus generation events,"" suggesting a focus on the context in which sensory stimuli are produced. Manual CQs that explore the influence of context (e.g., environmental factors, emotional states) on sensory perception may be absent.

4. **Quantitative Measures**: The generated CQ implies a need for quantitative assessments of sensory stimuli (e.g., intensity, duration). Manual CQs that incorporate quantitative measures or scales for sensory evaluation might be missing.

5. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQs may also encompass broader sensory experiences beyond just smell, such as visual or auditory stimuli. If the manual list is limited to specific sensory modalities, it may not fully capture the range of sensory questions that could be relevant.

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.45. The Jaccard similarity is notably low at 0.04, indicating that while the two questions may share some semantic content, they differ significantly in terms of the specific words and structure used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their generation. Manual CQs may not cover broader sensory experiences or the interplay between different senses (e.g., how visual stimuli might interact with olfactory memories).
   
2. **Contextual Factors**: The generated CQs may include questions about contextual factors influencing sensory perception (e.g., ""How does the environment affect the perception of a specific smell?""). If the manual list lacks such contextual inquiries, it could be a significant gap.

3. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions regarding the timing of sensory experiences (e.g., ""How does the timing of a sensory stimulus affect memory recall?"") may also be missing, as the generated CQs suggest a focus on the relationship between stimuli and experiences over time.

4. **Comparative Questions**: The generated CQs might include comparative questions (e.g., ""How do different smells compare in their ability to evoke memories?"") that are not present in the manual list.

5. **Mechanisms of Perception**: Questions that delve into the mechanisms of how sensory stimuli are processed (e.g., ""What neurological processes are involved in the perception of smells?"") could also be absent from the manual list.

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which professions are more present in smelling experience descriptions?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.46** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.10**. The cosine similarity indicates that the two questions share some semantic content, but the relatively low Jaccard similarity suggests that they do not share many common terms. This indicates that while the questions may be related in a broader context (e.g., sensory experiences), they focus on different aspects (one on sensory stimuli and the other on professions related to smell).

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover areas that the manual list does not.

Some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing include:

- **Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts indicates a focus on how different materials affect sensory experiences. If the manual list lacks questions addressing sensory experiences in cultural heritage, this could be a significant gap.

- **Material Substances**: The generated CQ emphasizes specific material substances, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. Questions that explore the relationship between materials and sensory experiences could be essential.

- **Cultural Heritage Contexts**: The context of cultural heritage is crucial and may not be fully explored in the manual list. Questions that investigate how cultural heritage influences sensory experiences or how sensory experiences are documented in cultural heritage could be missing.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach, linking sensory experiences with professions. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the intersection of different fields (e.g., anthropology, art conservation, sensory studies), this could represent a significant oversight.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs related to sensory experiences, material substances, cultural heritage contexts, and interdisciplinary connections. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.",[0.4584346115589142],0.4584346115589142,Which professions are more present in smelling experience descriptions?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.4584346115589142,0.6300154328346252

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which adjectives were used by [profession, e.g. medical practitioners] in describing smells?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.24
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.24 among all pairs analyzed, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity. However, the Jaccard similarity is very low at 0.03, suggesting that while the two questions may share some conceptual overlap, they differ significantly in terms of the specific terms and structure used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes the generation of sensory stimuli and the materials involved. If the manual list lacks questions that explore the nature of sensory stimuli or their sources, this could be a significant gap.
   
2. **Contextual Application**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which implies a context or scenario that may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that explore how sensory stimuli are generated in specific contexts (e.g., clinical settings, educational environments) could be missing.

3. **Descriptive Language**: The manual CQ focuses on adjectives used by professionals to describe smells. There may be a lack of questions that delve into the broader vocabulary or descriptive language used in various sensory contexts, such as taste, touch, or visual stimuli.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ could suggest a need for questions that compare different sensory stimuli or their effects, which may not be present in the manual list.

5. **Interdisciplinary Perspectives**: If the generated CQs include interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., combining psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics in understanding sensory experiences), and the manual list does not, this could indicate a missing dimension.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating questions that explore the generation and context of sensory stimuli, the vocabulary used to describe them, and comparative or interdisciplinary perspectives that are not currently represented.",[0.23625916242599487],0.23625916242599487,"Which adjectives were used by [profession, e.g. medical practitioners] in describing smells?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of this stimulus?,0.23625916242599487,0.5709449052810669

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells did people from [urban areas; rural areas; countries] describe most often?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.37
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content (as reflected in the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The cosine similarity score of 0.37 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but it is still relatively low, indicating that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their specific content or focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.37) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ about ""sensory stimuli"" encompasses a wider range of sensory experiences beyond just smell. This suggests that manual CQs may be missing questions related to other senses (e.g., sight, sound, touch) and their interactions with specific events or contexts.
   
2. **Material Sources or Carriers**: The generated CQ mentions ""material sources or carriers,"" which implies an interest in the origins or mediums of sensory stimuli. This aspect may not be covered in the manual list, indicating a gap in understanding how different materials influence sensory experiences.

3. **Contextual Variability**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which suggests a focus on the context or circumstances under which sensory stimuli are experienced. Manual CQs may lack questions that explore how different contexts (e.g., urban vs. rural settings) affect sensory perceptions.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of sensory stimuli across different events or conditions. If the manual list does not include questions that facilitate such comparisons, this could represent a significant gap.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address broader sensory experiences, the origins of stimuli, contextual influences, and comparative analyses of sensory perceptions. These elements are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the topic and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.",[0.3736042082309723],0.3736042082309723,Which smells did people from [urban areas; rural areas; countries] describe most often?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.3736042082309723,0.5624745488166809

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are normally accompanied with [other senses perceptions, e.g. taste]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.55
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00
- **BERTScore-F1**: Not explicitly provided for this pair, but the average BERTScore-F1 for all pairs is 0.57, indicating a reasonable level of semantic similarity.
- **BLEU**: 0.00 (indicating no n-gram overlap)
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.00 (indicating no overlap in longer sequences)

This pair stands out as the only one with a cosine similarity of 0.55, which is the maximum recorded for all pairs. The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 suggests that there is no overlap in the actual words used, but the semantic content may still be related, as indicated by the cosine similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity is relatively low (0.55) and that there are no matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover aspects or nuances that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Context of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their material sources indicates a broader inquiry into the relationship between stimuli and their origins. This could suggest a missing CQ that asks about the general relationship between different sensory modalities and their sources.
   
2. **Specificity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes specific events and their sensory outputs, which may not be captured in the manual list. A missing CQ could be: ""What specific events lead to the generation of sensory experiences across different modalities?""

3. **Interconnectedness of Sensory Perceptions**: The manual CQ focuses on smells and their association with other senses, but there may be a lack of questions that explore how different sensory perceptions interact or influence each other. A potential missing CQ could be: ""How do different sensory modalities influence the perception of a single stimulus?""

4. **Material Sources of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ explicitly mentions ""material sources or carriers,"" which may not be addressed in the manual list. A missing CQ could be: ""What are the material sources of sensory stimuli in various contexts?""

5. **Temporal Aspects of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ hints at the timing of stimulus generation events. A missing CQ could be: ""How do the timing and context of stimulus generation events affect sensory perception?""

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the themes of the generated and manual CQs, there are essential questions regarding the broader context, specificity, interconnectedness, material sources, and temporal aspects of sensory experiences that may be missing from the manual list.",[0.5515437126159668],0.5515437126159668,"Which smells are normally accompanied with [other senses perceptions, e.g. taste]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.5515437126159668,0.5747540593147278
0.5268605947494507,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the smelling gestures that are more connected with [smell type, e.g. putrid]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.39** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity score indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions, while the Jaccard similarity score suggests that there is a very low overlap in terms of the unique terms used in both questions.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.39**, which indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. The maximum cosine similarity is also **0.39**, suggesting that there is a lack of high-quality matches between the two sets.

- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of **0.6** is **0.00**, indicating that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of **0.6** or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or types of questions that the generated CQs cover.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of sensory stimuli that are not represented in the manual list. For example, the generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation event"" and ""material substantial,"" which may not be addressed in the manual CQs.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list might include:
  - Questions that explore the relationship between different sensory stimuli and their sources.
  - Inquiries into the mechanisms of sensory perception and how they relate to specific events or materials.
  - Questions that delve into the nuances of sensory experiences, such as the emotional or contextual aspects of stimuli.

In summary, the manual list appears to lack coverage of certain dimensions of sensory stimuli and their interactions, as evidenced by the low similarity scores and the absence of high-precision matches. Further analysis of the generated CQs could help identify specific topics or questions that should be included in the manual list to enhance its comprehensiveness.",[0.3850098252296448],0.3850098252296448,"What are the smelling gestures that are more connected with [smell type, e.g. putrid]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.3850098252296448,0.5268605947494507

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smelling gestures have been more described in [profession, e.g. tea-merchants]' experiences?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.42**, which is the maximum score recorded for all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common terms between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share specific vocabulary.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.42**, which indicates a moderate level of similarity between the generated and manual CQs, but it also suggests that there may be significant gaps in the manual list.
- The average Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, indicating that there are no overlapping terms, which may imply that the manual list does not cover certain aspects or terminologies present in the generated CQs.
- The average BLEU score is **0.00**, and the maximum BLEU score is also **0.00**, suggesting that there is no n-gram overlap between the generated and manual CQs, further supporting the idea that essential questions may be missing.
- The average ROUGE-L F1 score is very low at **0.06**, indicating minimal overlap in the longest common subsequences between the two sets.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list is missing CQs that address the following aspects:

- **Specific sensory experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes sensory stimuli and experiences, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list.
- **Contextual applications**: The generated CQ refers to specific events and contexts (e.g., ""stimulus generation event""), which may not be captured in the manual CQs.
- **Diverse sensory modalities**: The generated CQ mentions sensory experiences broadly, while the manual CQ focuses on ""smelling gestures,"" suggesting a narrower scope.

To identify specific missing CQs, a detailed review of the generated CQs would be necessary to pinpoint which concepts or questions are not represented in the manual list. This could involve looking for questions that explore different sensory modalities, contextual applications, or specific phenomena related to sensory experiences that are not currently included in the manual set.",[0.42489224672317505],0.42489224672317505,"Which smelling gestures have been more described in [profession, e.g. tea-merchants]' experiences?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.42489224672317505,0.5346987247467041

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.27
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.27, which indicates a moderate level of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions. However, the Jaccard similarity is quite low at 0.03, suggesting that the overlap in terms of unique words or phrases is minimal. This discrepancy indicates that while the questions may be conceptually related, they differ significantly in their specific wording and structure.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their material sources suggests a focus on the mechanisms of sensory perception and the origins of stimuli. If the manual list lacks questions that explore these broader contexts, it may miss essential inquiries into how sensory experiences are formed and understood.
  
- **Specificity to Ethnic Groups**: The generated CQ does not specifically mention ethnic groups, while the manual CQ does. This indicates that there may be a lack of questions in the manual that explore sensory experiences or perceptions specific to various ethnic or cultural groups, which could be crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach by mentioning ""stimulus generation"" and ""material sources."" If the manual list does not include questions that bridge sensory studies with other fields (e.g., psychology, anthropology, or sociology), it may be missing essential inquiries that could enrich the understanding of sensory stimuli.

- **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of different sensory stimuli and their sources. If the manual list lacks questions that encourage comparisons between different sensory experiences or cultural interpretations of stimuli, it may overlook important dimensions of the topic.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore broader contexts, specificity to ethnic groups, interdisciplinary connections, and comparative analyses of sensory stimuli.

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.24
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair represents the maximum cosine similarity found among all pairs, indicating that while there is some degree of similarity in terms of vector representation, it is relatively low. The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which is consistent with the low cosine similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.24) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Focus**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli suggests a focus on sensory experiences, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions that explore sensory perceptions, this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Contextual Associations**: The manual CQ regarding flavors associated with femininity in Asia indicates a cultural or contextual aspect. If the generated CQs include questions about cultural associations or contextual factors that are not reflected in the manual list, these would be essential to include.

3. **Specificity in Events**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which implies a need for questions that address specific events or occurrences. If the manual list does not include questions that delve into specific events or phenomena, this could be another area where essential CQs are missing.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ's structure suggests a comparative or analytical approach to sensory experiences. If the manual list lacks questions that encourage comparison or analysis of different sensory experiences or stimuli, this could represent another gap.

### Conclusion

In summary, the only pair with the highest similarity is between a generated CQ about sensory stimuli and a manual CQ about flavors associated with femininity. The analysis indicates that essential CQs related to sensory experiences, contextual associations, specificity in events, and comparative analysis may be missing from the manual list.

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What are [smells, e.g. floral scents] mostly associated with?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.45
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.45, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.10 suggests that there is a low overlap in the terms used in both questions, which is consistent with the nature of the questions being somewhat different in focus but still related in the broader context of sensory experiences.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average similarity scores across various metrics (e.g., average cosine similarity of 0.45, average Jaccard similarity of 0.10), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or angles that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts indicates a focus on a broader range of sensory experiences (beyond just smells) that may not be captured in the manual list. This could include visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli associated with cultural heritage.

2. **Material Substances**: The emphasis on ""specific material substances"" in the generated CQ suggests a focus on the relationship between materials and sensory experiences, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual CQs. This could lead to questions about how different materials (e.g., wood, stone, textiles) contribute to sensory experiences in cultural heritage.

3. **Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ's reference to ""cultural heritage contexts"" implies a need for questions that explore how cultural significance influences sensory perceptions. This aspect may be underrepresented in the manual list, which could focus more on general sensory associations without the cultural dimension.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQs may also touch upon interdisciplinary connections between sensory studies, cultural heritage, and material science, which might not be fully explored in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address broader sensory experiences, the role of specific materials, cultural contexts, and interdisciplinary connections, all of which are suggested by the generated CQs. This indicates a potential gap in the manual's coverage of the topic, which could be important for a comprehensive understanding of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage.",[0.445838987827301],0.445838987827301,"What are [smells, e.g. floral scents] mostly associated with?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.445838987827301,0.5836151242256165

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which scents were linked to the idea of heaven in X period?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.36** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.07**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is also quite low, indicating that the specific terms used in the questions differ significantly.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or angles that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs:**

1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and cultural heritage contexts suggests a focus on the interplay between sensory experiences and cultural interpretations. If the manual list lacks questions that explore how different cultures perceive sensory stimuli or how these perceptions influence cultural practices, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Specificity in Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes specific sensory stimuli and their generation events. If the manual list does not include questions that delve into the specifics of sensory experiences (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory) in various contexts, this could be another area that is underrepresented.

3. **Temporal and Cultural Dynamics**: The generated CQ hints at the evolution of sensory perceptions over time and across cultures. If the manual list does not address how sensory experiences change with cultural shifts or historical contexts, this could be a critical omission.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ suggests a potential interdisciplinary approach, linking sensory experiences with cultural heritage. If the manual list does not include questions that bridge disciplines (e.g., anthropology, psychology, art history), this could indicate a lack of comprehensive coverage.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore broader contextual, specific sensory experiences, temporal dynamics, and interdisciplinary connections related to sensory stimuli and cultural heritage. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness and relevance of the manual CQs.",[0.35561391711235046],0.35561391711235046,Which scents were linked to the idea of heaven in X period?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.35561391711235046,0.5933864712715149

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual competency questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What was an erotic scent in X period?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.34
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.10

This pair represents the highest similarity across all evaluated pairs, with both the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores indicating a relatively low level of overlap in terms of content and vocabulary. The cosine similarity of 0.34 suggests that while there is some semantic overlap, it is not particularly strong. The Jaccard similarity of 0.10 further emphasizes that the intersection of the sets of words used in both questions is minimal.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.34) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their cultural implications. If the manual list lacks questions that explore broader themes of sensory experiences in cultural heritage, such as ""How do different cultures interpret sensory experiences?"" or ""What role do sensory stimuli play in cultural identity?"", these could be considered essential missing questions.

2. **Temporal and Historical Aspects**: The generated CQ about ""specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts"" implies a need for questions that address historical changes in sensory experiences, such as ""How have sensory perceptions of materials changed over different historical periods?"" 

3. **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultures or time periods could also be missing. For example, ""How do sensory stimuli differ between two distinct cultural heritage contexts?"" would provide a comparative angle that may not be present in the manual list.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Questions that connect sensory experiences to other fields, such as psychology or anthropology, could also be essential. For instance, ""What psychological effects do sensory stimuli from cultural heritage have on individuals?"" could be a valuable addition.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in broader, comparative, and interdisciplinary questions that address the complexities of sensory experiences in cultural heritage contexts. The generated CQs suggest a need for a more comprehensive exploration of these themes, which could enhance the overall understanding of the subject matter.",[0.34255853295326233],0.34255853295326233,What was an erotic scent in X period?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.34255853295326233,0.6674744486808777

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What was the scent of cleanliness in X period?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.37** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.09**. The cosine similarity indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar overall. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is quite low, suggesting that the specific words used in the two questions differ significantly.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given the low average similarities across various metrics (cosine, Jaccard, BLEU, ROUGE-L), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Key Observations:**
- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be adequately captured in the manual list.
- The manual list may lack questions that explore the relationships between sensory stimuli and their contexts or origins, as indicated by the generated CQ that references ""stimulus generation events"" and ""material substantial.""

**Potential Missing CQs:**
1. Questions that explore the relationship between different sensory stimuli (e.g., ""How do different sensory stimuli interact during a specific event?"").
2. Questions that inquire about the origins or sources of specific sensory experiences (e.g., ""What materials contribute to the perception of cleanliness in a given context?"").
3. Questions that address the temporal aspects of sensory experiences (e.g., ""How has the perception of cleanliness changed over different historical periods?"").

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that delve into the nuances of sensory experiences, their origins, and their contextual relationships, which are highlighted in the generated CQs. This indicates a potential gap in the manual's coverage of the topic, suggesting that additional questions focusing on these aspects could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.",[0.3682655096054077],0.3682655096054077,What was the scent of cleanliness in X period?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.3682655096054077,0.5737096071243286

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What feelings were associated with [a particular smell] in [parts of Europe] at [a given time]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.43
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.43, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.04 suggests that there is a very low overlap in the actual terms used in both questions, which may indicate that while the questions are conceptually related, they use different language and focus on different aspects of sensory experiences.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.04) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Focus on Sensory Mechanisms**: The generated CQs seem to emphasize the mechanisms of sensory perception and the events that lead to sensory experiences. If the manual list lacks questions that explore how sensory stimuli are processed or the neurological aspects of sensory experiences, this could be a significant gap.

2. **Temporal and Contextual Aspects**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation event,"" which implies a focus on the timing and context of sensory experiences. If the manual list does not include questions that address the timing or contextual factors influencing sensory perception, this could be another area that is underrepresented.

3. **Comparative or Relational Questions**: The generated CQs may also include comparative questions (e.g., comparing different sensory experiences or stimuli). If the manual list is primarily focused on singular experiences without exploring relationships or comparisons, this could indicate missing essential CQs.

4. **Emotional and Psychological Dimensions**: The manual CQ mentions ""feelings associated with a particular smell,"" which indicates an emotional aspect. If the generated CQs explore broader emotional or psychological dimensions of sensory experiences that are not captured in the manual list, this could represent another gap.

In summary, the essential CQs missing from the manual list likely pertain to the mechanisms of sensory perception, the influence of context and timing, comparative aspects of sensory experiences, and the emotional or psychological dimensions of sensory stimuli. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would help identify specific questions that fill these gaps.",[0.43243759870529175],0.43243759870529175,What feelings were associated with [a particular smell] in [parts of Europe] at [a given time]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.43243759870529175,0.5770806670188904
0.6375953555107117,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What was the dominant/average hedonic tone of smell descriptions in [period] and/or [place]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.59**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.17**, indicating some overlap in terms of shared terms or concepts, but not a high degree of similarity. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically need to analyze the content and intent of the generated CQs in comparison to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer a few points:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.59**, which suggests that while there is some overlap, the generated CQs may be exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic compared to the manual CQs. The lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual ones.

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQ about sensory experiences in cultural heritage odours suggests a focus on the experiential and sensory aspects of smell, which may not be fully captured in the manual CQs that focus on hedonic tone. This indicates that there may be a gap in the manual list regarding questions that explore sensory experiences, emotional responses, or cultural contexts related to odours.

- **Potential Missing CQs**: Essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list might include:
  - Questions that delve into the **cultural significance** of specific odours or sensory experiences.
  - Inquiries about the **psychological or emotional impacts** of smells in different contexts.
  - Questions that explore the **relationship between sensory stimuli and memory** or **identity** in cultural heritage.

In summary, while the manual list may cover certain aspects of sensory experiences related to odours, it appears to lack questions that address the broader implications of these experiences, particularly in cultural contexts. This suggests a need for more comprehensive coverage of sensory and emotional dimensions in the manual CQs.",[0.5927345156669617],0.5927345156669617,What was the dominant/average hedonic tone of smell descriptions in [period] and/or [place]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.5927345156669617,0.6375953555107117

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were these stimuli perceived in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What odours [disgusted OR pleased] [social marker e.g gender, race, nationality, age] Europeans?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.47
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.03

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.47, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity is very low at 0.03, suggesting that while the questions may share some semantic content, they do not have much overlap in terms of the specific words or phrases used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.03) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ emphasizes the perception of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list. This suggests a gap in exploring how different cultures interpret sensory experiences.

2. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" indicating a focus on particular instances or events that produce sensory stimuli. If the manual list lacks questions that delve into specific events or contexts, this could be a significant omission.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of sensory stimuli and their perception, which may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that compare different sensory experiences or cultural interpretations could be missing.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach by linking sensory perception with cultural heritage. If the manual list does not include questions that bridge different fields (e.g., psychology, anthropology, and cultural studies), this could represent a gap.

5. **Emotional Responses**: The generated CQ mentions the perception of stimuli, which may involve emotional responses. If the manual list does not include questions that explore emotional reactions to sensory stimuli, this could be another area that needs to be addressed.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on cultural contexts, specificity of sensory stimuli, comparative analyses, interdisciplinary connections, and emotional responses to sensory experiences. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.",[0.4700632691383362],0.4700632691383362,"What odours [disgusted OR pleased] [social marker e.g gender, race, nationality, age] Europeans?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were these stimuli perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.4700632691383362,0.472453773021698

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What sorts of scents were produced to create a certain emotion [pleasure]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.63** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.07**. The cosine similarity indicates a relatively high degree of semantic similarity between the two questions, suggesting that they share some common concepts or themes, particularly in the context of sensory stimuli and emotional responses. However, the low Jaccard similarity indicates that the overlap in unique terms is minimal, which is typical when the questions are conceptually related but use different wording or focus on different aspects of the topic.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given that the generated CQs have a high average cosine similarity (0.63) with the manual CQs, it suggests that they are likely addressing similar themes or topics. However, the low Jaccard similarity (0.07) indicates that there may be unique aspects or specific questions in the generated set that are not captured in the manual set.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
1. **Focus on Specific Sensory Modalities**: The generated CQ emphasizes ""sensory stimuli"" and ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which may suggest a broader exploration of sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) that might not be fully represented in the manual list.
  
2. **Material Sources or Carriers**: The mention of ""material sources or carriers"" in the generated CQ indicates a focus on the origins or mediums of sensory stimuli, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual CQs. This could be an essential aspect for understanding the context of sensory experiences.

3. **Emotional Context**: While the manual CQ mentions ""emotion [pleasure],"" the generated CQ's broader inquiry into sensory stimuli and their generation events may suggest additional emotional contexts or responses that are not covered in the manual list.

4. **Temporal or Contextual Aspects**: The generated CQ's reference to ""specific stimulus generation events"" implies a temporal or situational context that may be missing from the manual CQs, which could be crucial for understanding how sensory stimuli are perceived or experienced over time.

In summary, while the manual list captures some essential questions, it may lack depth in exploring the variety of sensory modalities, the origins of stimuli, and the contextual factors influencing emotional responses. Further analysis of the generated CQs could help identify additional essential questions that would enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.",[0.6348736882209778],0.6348736882209778,What sorts of scents were produced to create a certain emotion [pleasure]?,1.0,1,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.6348736882209778,0.6299198269844055

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smell triggers memories of [childhood]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.50
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic space (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any common words or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity). The cosine similarity of 0.50 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but the Jaccard score of 0.00 indicates that they are quite different in terms of their lexical content.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Lack of Diversity**: The average cosine similarity of 0.50 across all pairs suggests that the generated CQs are somewhat similar to the manual CQs, but the maximum cosine similarity being the same as the average indicates a lack of diversity in the generated questions. This could imply that the generated CQs are not covering a wide range of topics or perspectives that might be present in the manual list.

- **Missing Topics**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and cultural heritage contexts suggests a focus on sensory experiences and their cultural implications. If the manual list does not include questions that explore sensory experiences, cultural contexts, or the relationship between stimuli and memory, then these could be considered essential CQs that are missing.

- **Specificity and Context**: The generated CQ also emphasizes specific events and perceptions, which may not be captured in broader or more general manual CQs. If the manual list lacks questions that delve into specific events or the nuances of perception in cultural contexts, these would also be essential CQs that are missing.

In summary, essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list could include:
- Questions that explore the relationship between sensory stimuli and memory, particularly in cultural contexts.
- Questions that address specific events related to sensory experiences.
- Questions that investigate the perception of sensory stimuli in various cultural heritage settings.

To fully identify the missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the themes and topics covered in both the generated and manual lists would be necessary. However, based on the provided statistics and the nature of the generated CQ, the above points highlight potential gaps in the manual list.",[0.5029993653297424],0.5029993653297424,Which smell triggers memories of [childhood]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.5029993653297424,0.5320823788642883

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what were their sources and carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells remember of past people or past places (commemoration)?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.36
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.36 among all pairs analyzed. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 indicates that there are no common words or tokens between the two questions, suggesting that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share any lexical overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimuli and Their Sources**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their sources indicates a focus on the mechanisms of sensory perception, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
2. **Event-Driven Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes the context of specific events leading to sensory experiences, which could be a critical aspect of understanding sensory memory and its triggers.
3. **Commemoration and Memory**: While the manual CQ touches on smells related to past experiences, there may be a broader range of sensory experiences (beyond just smells) that relate to memory and commemoration that are not captured.
4. **Comparative Analysis of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ suggests a comparative approach to understanding different sensory stimuli, which may not be present in the manual list.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is a single pair of CQs with the highest similarity, the overall low similarity scores suggest a significant divergence in the content and focus of the generated and manual CQs. This divergence points to potential gaps in the manual list, particularly regarding the exploration of sensory stimuli, their sources, and the context of sensory experiences related to memory and commemoration. It may be beneficial to review the generated CQs for additional insights and dimensions that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.",[0.36198890209198],0.36198890209198,Which smells remember of past people or past places (commemoration)?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what were their sources and carriers?,0.36198890209198,0.5044043660163879
0.5727099776268005,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated in the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific instance of stimulus generation and what material substantial was involved in generating these stimuli?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which types of practices produce a bad smell?""

The similarity metrics for this pair are as follows:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.29
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.29 across all pairs, indicating that it is the most similar pair in terms of the generated and manual CQs.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.29 and the maximum of 0.29 suggest that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. The average Jaccard similarity of 0.07 and BLEU score of 0.01 further indicate a lack of overlap in content and phrasing.
  
- **Precision@0.6**: The precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, meaning that none of the generated CQs matched with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs. This suggests that there are likely significant gaps in the manual list regarding the topics or types of questions that the generated CQs cover.

- **Content Analysis**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific instances of sensory stimuli and the materials involved in generating them, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. The manual CQ about practices producing a bad smell is quite specific and may not encompass broader or different types of sensory experiences or stimuli.

Given these observations, it is likely that essential CQs related to:
- Different types of sensory experiences (beyond just smell)
- The relationship between materials and sensory stimuli
- Broader categories of practices that affect sensory perceptions

are missing from the manual list. A more comprehensive manual list would benefit from including questions that explore these areas, as they appear to be well-represented in the generated CQs but not in the manual ones. 

In summary, the manual list may lack essential CQs that address the broader context of sensory stimuli and their generation, which are present in the generated set.",[0.2898765802383423],0.2898765802383423,Which types of practices produce a bad smell?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific instance of stimulus generation and what material substantial was involved in generating these stimuli?,0.2898765802383423,0.5727099776268005

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which types of practices produce [smell, e.g. sweet]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.37
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.37 among all pairs analyzed. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 indicates that there are no common terms between the two questions, suggesting that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share any specific vocabulary.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, particularly the average Jaccard and BLEU scores of 0.00, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs in terms of wording or phrasing.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and experiences indicates a focus on the relationship between stimuli and perception, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This could suggest a gap in exploring how different sensory experiences are categorized or described.

2. **Event-Driven Sensory Production**: The generated CQ emphasizes the context of ""stimulus generation events,"" which may not be addressed in the manual list. This could indicate a need for questions that explore how specific events lead to sensory perceptions.

3. **Types of Sensory Stimuli**: The manual CQ focuses on types of practices that produce specific smells, but there may be a lack of questions addressing other sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory) or the broader categorization of sensory stimuli.

4. **Comparative Analysis of Sensory Practices**: The generated CQ suggests a potential for comparative questions that examine different practices or events and their sensory outcomes, which may not be present in the manual list.

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some conceptual overlap between the generated and manual CQs, there are significant gaps in specificity and breadth of inquiry regarding sensory experiences and their generation. This suggests that the manual list may benefit from the inclusion of more diverse and detailed questions related to sensory stimuli and their contexts.",[0.36607638001441956],0.36607638001441956,"Which types of practices produce [smell, e.g. sweet]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.36607638001441956,0.5419291257858276

**Similarity Scores**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.24
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.09

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.24, which indicates a low level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.09 further confirms that there is minimal overlap in the terms used in both questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Key Observations**:
- The generated CQ focuses on sensory stimuli and their sources, which may imply a focus on the scientific or psychological aspects of sensory perception.
- The manual CQ, on the other hand, is more practical and relates to cooking and its effects, specifically the production of bad smells.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Perception**: Questions that explore the relationship between sensory stimuli and human perception, such as ""How do different sensory stimuli affect human emotions?""
2. **Material Sources**: Questions that delve into the origins of materials used in cooking or other activities, such as ""What are the common sources of materials that produce strong odors during cooking?""
3. **Event-Driven Stimuli**: Questions that investigate specific events that generate sensory stimuli, such as ""What events lead to the generation of specific sensory experiences in cooking?""

Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the manual list lacks questions that explore the scientific, psychological, or event-driven aspects of sensory stimuli, which are present in the generated CQs. 

### Conclusion

In summary, the highest similarity pair indicates a minimal overlap in content and focus between the generated and manual CQs. The manual list may be missing essential questions that address the broader implications of sensory stimuli and their sources, which could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.",[0.2363327145576477],0.2363327145576477,What types of cooking produce a bad smell?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.2363327145576477,0.5582518577575684

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What types of cooking are producing [smell, e.g. sweet]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.33
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.33 among all pairs analyzed. The Jaccard similarity is notably low at 0.04, indicating that while the two questions may share some semantic content, they differ significantly in terms of the specific terms used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimulus Generation**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their sources indicates a focus on the process of sensory stimulus generation, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This could include questions about how different stimuli are produced and their origins.

2. **Material Sources**: The mention of ""material substantial"" in the generated CQ suggests a focus on the physical materials involved in sensory experiences. This aspect may not be adequately represented in the manual list, which could be more focused on the types of cooking rather than the materials used.

3. **Specificity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ implies a need for specificity regarding the types of sensory experiences (e.g., smell, taste) and their contexts. If the manual list lacks questions that delve into specific sensory experiences and their contexts, this could be a significant gap.

4. **Event Contextualization**: The generated CQ references ""stimulus generation event,"" which suggests a temporal or situational context for sensory experiences. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the context in which sensory stimuli are generated, this could be another area of omission.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some overlap in the content of the generated and manual CQs, there are significant differences in focus and specificity. The generated CQs appear to explore broader and more detailed aspects of sensory stimuli and their origins, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. Identifying and incorporating these missing elements could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs.",[0.3302674889564514],0.3302674889564514,"What types of cooking are producing [smell, e.g. sweet]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.3302674889564514,0.5305663347244263
0.6403160095214844,"To analyze the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs) based on the provided statistics, we can break down the findings as follows:

### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which practice can increment a smell intensity?""

**Similarity Scores**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.48
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.48, which is the maximum recorded for all pairs. The Jaccard similarity score of 0.04 indicates that while there is some overlap in the terms used, the overall content and structure of the questions are quite different.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given that the average cosine similarity across all pairs is relatively low (0.48), and the precision at a threshold of 0.6 is 0.00, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Key Observations**:
- The average Jaccard similarity of 0.04 indicates minimal overlap in terms of shared vocabulary or concepts between the generated and manual CQs.
- The average BLEU score of 0.01 and ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.08 further suggest that the generated CQs are not closely matching the manual CQs in terms of n-gram overlap or content similarity.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
While the specific content of the manual CQs is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions may be essential but missing based on the context of cultural heritage and sensory experiences:

1. **Questions about Specific Sensory Experiences**: 
   - ""How do different materials affect the perception of smell in cultural heritage contexts?""
   - ""What role do olfactory stimuli play in the preservation of cultural heritage?""

2. **Questions on Methods of Enhancing Sensory Experiences**:
   - ""What techniques can be employed to enhance the olfactory experience in cultural heritage sites?""
   - ""How can the intensity of smells be measured in cultural heritage environments?""

3. **Questions on the Impact of Sensory Stimuli**:
   - ""What impact do sensory stimuli have on visitor engagement in cultural heritage sites?""
   - ""How do cultural practices influence the perception of smells in heritage contexts?""

4. **Questions on the Relationship between Material and Sensory Perception**:
   - ""What materials are known to retain or amplify specific odours in cultural heritage artifacts?""

These examples illustrate the types of questions that may be essential for a comprehensive understanding of the sensory aspects of cultural heritage, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. The generated CQs seem to focus on specific aspects of sensory stimuli, but there may be broader questions regarding the implications, methods, and relationships that are not represented. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that while there is some similarity between the generated and manual CQs, there are likely significant gaps in the manual list that could be filled with broader and more specific questions related to sensory experiences in cultural heritage contexts.",[0.4800456464290619],0.4800456464290619,Which practice can increment a smell intensity?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.4800456464290619,0.6403160095214844
0.6379117965698242,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which practice can reduce a smell intensity?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.32
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic space (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or tokens (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity). The cosine similarity of 0.32 suggests a moderate level of similarity in terms of the vector representation of the questions, but the Jaccard score of 0.00 indicates that there are no overlapping words or phrases.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- **Average Cosine Similarity**: 0.32 indicates that there is some level of similarity between the generated and manual CQs, but it is relatively low.
- **Average Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00 suggests that there are no shared terms between the generated and manual CQs, indicating a potential gap in the topics or concepts covered.
- **Precision@0.6**: 0.00 indicates that none of the generated CQs have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher with any of the manual CQs, suggesting that the generated CQs may be addressing different aspects or dimensions of the subject matter.

Given these statistics, it can be inferred that the manual list may be lacking in coverage of certain topics or dimensions that are present in the generated CQs. Specifically, the generated CQ about ""sensory stimuli"" in ""cultural heritage contexts"" suggests a focus on sensory experiences and material interactions that may not be adequately represented in the manual list, which seems to focus more narrowly on practices related to smell intensity.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- Questions that explore the relationship between sensory experiences and material substances in cultural heritage.
- Questions that address the broader implications of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts, such as their impact on visitor experiences or conservation practices.
- Questions that investigate other sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory) in relation to cultural heritage materials.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating CQs that explore the sensory dimensions of cultural heritage, as well as the interactions between materials and sensory experiences, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.",[0.3192252516746521],0.3192252516746521,Which practice can reduce a smell intensity?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.3192252516746521,0.6379117965698242
0.6480312347412109,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which practice can modify an existing smell?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.50**. However, it is important to note that while this is the highest similarity score reported, it is relatively low, indicating that the two questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, suggesting that there are no common terms between the two questions, which further emphasizes the lack of overlap in their content.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics provided:

- The average cosine similarity across all pairs is **0.50**, which indicates that there is some level of similarity, but it is not strong.
- The average Jaccard similarity is **0.00**, suggesting that the questions do not share common terms, which may imply that the generated CQs are exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic compared to the manual CQs.
- The average BERTScore-F1 is **0.65**, which indicates that while the questions may not share many terms, they may still convey similar meanings or intents at a deeper semantic level.

Given these observations, it is likely that the manual list of CQs is missing questions that address the following aspects:

1. **Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage suggests a focus on the sensory experiences related to materials and smells, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list.
  
2. **Cultural Heritage Context**: The generated CQ emphasizes the context of cultural heritage, which may require specific questions related to the preservation, modification, or understanding of smells in cultural settings.

3. **Material Interaction**: The generated CQ implies a relationship between materials and sensory stimuli, suggesting that questions about how different materials interact with sensory perceptions could be missing.

4. **Modification Practices**: While the manual CQ touches on modifying smells, it may not encompass broader practices or methodologies related to sensory modification in cultural heritage contexts.

In summary, the essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list likely revolve around sensory experiences, cultural heritage contexts, material interactions, and broader practices related to smell modification. These areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list and ensure that it captures the full scope of inquiry represented by the generated CQs.",[0.5018082857131958],0.5018082857131958,Which practice can modify an existing smell?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.5018082857131958,0.6480312347412109
0.5582781434059143,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What smells produced what kinds of practices?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.40
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar. The cosine similarity of 0.40 suggests a moderate level of similarity in terms of vector representation, while the Jaccard similarity of 0.05 indicates that they share very few common terms or elements.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Context**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and experiences indicates a focus on the relationship between sensory events and perceptions. If the manual list lacks questions that explore how different sensory stimuli affect human experiences or behaviors, this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Specificity of Stimuli**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation event,"" which implies a need for questions that delve into particular types of stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory) and their unique impacts. If the manual list does not include questions that differentiate between types of sensory stimuli, this could be another area of omission.

3. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at a connection between sensory experiences and practices, suggesting that there may be a need for questions that explore how sensory experiences influence cultural or social practices. If the manual list does not address these interdisciplinary connections, it may be lacking in depth.

4. **Temporal Aspects of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ implies a temporal aspect (""during a sensory experience""). If the manual list does not include questions that consider the timing or duration of sensory experiences, this could represent another missing element.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is some overlap between the generated and manual CQs, the low similarity scores suggest that the manual list may not fully encompass the range of questions that could be relevant to the topic. Essential CQs that explore the nuances of sensory experiences, the specificity of stimuli, interdisciplinary connections, and temporal aspects may be missing from the manual list.",[0.3969551920890808],0.3969551920890808,What smells produced what kinds of practices?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.3969551920890808,0.5582781434059143

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which practice changed the smells it produced over time?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.45
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content (as reflected in the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The cosine similarity of 0.45 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but the lack of overlap in terms means that they are likely addressing different aspects of sensory stimuli and practices.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, we can infer the following:

- **Low Similarity Scores**: The average cosine similarity of 0.45 indicates that the generated CQs are somewhat aligned with the manual CQs, but the maximum similarity is capped at 0.45, suggesting that there may be significant gaps in the manual list.
- **Lack of Overlap**: The average Jaccard similarity of 0.00 and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicate that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs in terms of vocabulary or phrasing. This suggests that the manual list may be missing CQs that address similar themes or concepts as the generated CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their sources suggests a need for manual CQs that explore the relationship between sensory experiences and their origins. This could include questions about how different stimuli affect perception or how they are produced.
  
2. **Material Sources**: The mention of ""material sources or carriers"" in the generated CQ indicates a potential gap in the manual list regarding the exploration of the physical or material aspects of sensory experiences.

3. **Temporal Changes**: The generated CQ's focus on ""specific stimulus generation events"" implies a need for questions that address how sensory experiences evolve over time, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list.

4. **Comparative Practices**: The manual CQ about practices changing smells suggests a need for questions that compare different practices or methods in generating sensory stimuli, which may not be fully represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore the nuances of sensory stimuli, their material sources, temporal changes, and comparative practices, as indicated by the generated CQs.",[0.4463021457195282],0.4463021457195282,Which practice changed the smells it produced over time?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.4463021457195282,0.5871298313140869

- **Manual CQ**: ""Who were the people associated with the practices that produced/reduced smell?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.42
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content (as reflected in the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The cosine similarity of 0.42 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but the lack of overlap in terms means that they are likely addressing different aspects of a broader topic.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the statistics and the nature of the generated CQs. Given the average cosine similarity of 0.42 and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on sensory experiences and cultural heritage contexts. If the manual list lacks questions that explore sensory perceptions, cultural practices, or the relationship between sensory stimuli and cultural heritage, these could be considered essential missing CQs.
  
- **Specificity in Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli implies a need for questions that delve into specific sensory experiences (e.g., smell, taste, sight) and their cultural implications. If the manual list does not include questions that address these specific sensory modalities, they would be essential to include.

- **Cultural Heritage Practices**: Questions that explore the practices, rituals, or historical contexts surrounding sensory experiences in cultural heritage may also be missing. For example, inquiries into how different cultures interpret or utilize sensory stimuli could be vital.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Given the nature of the generated CQs, there may be a need for questions that connect sensory experiences with other disciplines, such as anthropology, psychology, or history, which may not be represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that focus on sensory experiences, cultural practices, and interdisciplinary connections related to sensory stimuli and cultural heritage. These areas should be explored further to ensure a comprehensive set of competency questions.",[0.4227162301540375],0.4227162301540375,Who were the people associated with the practices that produced/reduced smell?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and how was it perceived in a cultural heritage context?,0.4227162301540375,0.6033766865730286

- **Manual CQ**: ""Where were the practices that produced/reduced smell located [city/countryside/underground]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.45
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.05

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.45, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.05 suggests that there is very little overlap in the actual terms used in the questions, which may indicate that while the questions are conceptually related, they are phrased quite differently.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.05) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts indicates a focus on sensory experiences, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list. Questions exploring how different senses (sight, sound, smell, etc.) interact with cultural heritage could be essential.
  
2. **Material Interaction**: The generated CQ emphasizes the interaction between material substances and sensory stimuli. This aspect may be missing from the manual list, which could benefit from questions that explore the relationship between materials and sensory perceptions in cultural heritage.

3. **Contextual Practices**: The manual CQ regarding the location of practices that produce or reduce smell suggests a focus on specific practices. However, there may be a lack of questions addressing broader contextual factors, such as how cultural heritage practices vary across different environments or communities.

4. **Cultural Significance of Sensory Elements**: Questions that delve into the cultural significance of sensory elements in heritage contexts may also be missing. For example, inquiries into how different cultures interpret sensory experiences related to their heritage could provide valuable insights.

5. **Temporal Changes**: Questions that explore how sensory experiences related to cultural heritage have changed over time or how they are preserved could also be essential but may not be represented in the manual list.

In summary, the generated CQs suggest a broader exploration of sensory experiences and their relationship with material culture, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions related to cultural heritage.",[0.4474165439605713],0.4474165439605713,Where were the practices that produced/reduced smell located [city/countryside/underground]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.4474165439605713,0.5877894759178162

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.31
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.15

This indicates that while there is some overlap in the concepts being addressed, the similarity scores are relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The cosine similarity of 0.31 is the maximum observed across all pairs, indicating that this is the most similar pair in the dataset.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
- **Sensory Experience Focus**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli indicates a focus on the relationship between sensory events and experiences. If the manual list lacks questions that explore sensory experiences, perceptions, or the impact of specific stimuli on health, this could be a significant gap.
  
- **Temporal Context**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation event,"" which implies a temporal aspect that may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that address the timing or historical context of sensory experiences or health-related scents could be missing.

- **Protective Health Aspects**: The manual CQ mentions ""protective [health] scent,"" but the generated CQ does not explicitly address health-related implications of sensory stimuli. Questions that explore the health benefits or protective qualities of certain scents or stimuli could be essential.

- **Broader Sensory Modalities**: The generated CQ focuses on sensory stimuli, which may imply a broader range of sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory). If the manual list is limited to specific types of sensory experiences, it may miss out on questions that encompass a wider range of sensory interactions.

In summary, the analysis suggests that the manual list may be missing CQs that address the broader implications of sensory experiences, the temporal context of stimuli, and the health-related aspects of sensory perceptions. These gaps could be critical for a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand.",[0.3103223443031311],0.3103223443031311,What was a protective [health] scent in X period?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.3103223443031311,0.5728788375854492

This pair has a lower cosine similarity of 0.10, indicating a weaker relationship compared to the first pair. Again, the Jaccard similarity is 0.00, showing no overlap in terms.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs and their context. The generated CQs focus on sensory stimuli and their perception, which may not be fully represented in the manual list. 

Given the generated CQ ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?"", it suggests a focus on the relationship between specific stimuli and sensory experiences. The manual list, particularly the questions about smells associated with hygiene, does not seem to cover broader sensory experiences or the generation of stimuli.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **General Sensory Experience**: Questions that explore various sensory experiences beyond just smell, such as taste, sight, sound, and touch, could be missing. For example:
   - ""What sensory experiences are triggered by specific environmental stimuli?""
   - ""How do different stimuli affect sensory perception in humans?""

2. **Stimulus Generation Events**: Questions that delve into the events or contexts that lead to the generation of sensory stimuli might also be absent. For example:
   - ""What events lead to the generation of specific sensory stimuli in different environments?""
   - ""How do cultural factors influence the perception of sensory stimuli?""

3. **Comparative Sensory Analysis**: Questions that compare different types of sensory stimuli or experiences could also be relevant. For example:
   - ""How do different sensory stimuli interact to create a holistic sensory experience?""
   - ""What are the differences in sensory perception between natural and artificial stimuli?""

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in questions that address broader sensory experiences, the context of stimulus generation, and comparative analyses of sensory stimuli. These areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.",[0.3095890283584595],0.20563212037086487,"Which smells are associated with hygiene?

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are associated with [general place e.g. schools, churches, docks, ships]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.31
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.31, indicating a moderate level of similarity in terms of vector representation. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, indicating that while they may be conceptually related, they do not share any lexical overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes the generation of sensory stimuli and the materials involved. This aspect may not be adequately covered in the manual list, which focuses more on associations rather than the process of generation.
   
2. **Contextual Variability**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which implies a focus on particular instances or contexts. The manual list may lack questions that explore how different contexts influence sensory experiences.

3. **Material Sources**: The generated CQ mentions ""material substantial"" as a source of stimuli, which could lead to questions about the types of materials that produce specific sensory experiences. This could be an area not explored in the manual list.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ could lead to questions that compare different sensory stimuli or events, which may not be present in the manual list.

5. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions regarding how sensory stimuli change over time or in different conditions may also be missing.

### Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while there is a pair of CQs with the highest similarity, the overall low similarity scores suggest that the generated CQs may introduce new dimensions or aspects of inquiry that are not captured in the manual list. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs for additional themes or questions that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list.",[0.30785948038101196],0.30785948038101196,"Which smells are associated with [general place e.g. schools, churches, docks, ships]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of this stimulus?,0.30785948038101196,0.5407273769378662

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific stimulus generation event, and what material substantial sources are associated with these stimuli?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are associated with [specific place e.g. the Amsterdam stock exchange]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.29
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.14

This pair represents the highest similarity across all generated and manual competency questions. The cosine similarity of 0.29 indicates a moderate level of similarity in terms of vector representation, while the Jaccard similarity of 0.14 suggests that there is some overlap in the terms used, but it is relatively low.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential competency questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.29) and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their sources. If the manual list lacks questions that explore broader contexts or categories of sensory experiences (e.g., ""What types of sensory experiences can be associated with urban environments?""), this could be a significant gap.

2. **Comparative Questions**: Questions that compare different sensory stimuli or their effects in various contexts may be missing. For example, ""How do sensory stimuli differ between urban and rural settings?"" could provide valuable insights.

3. **Temporal or Situational Questions**: Questions that consider the temporal aspect of sensory experiences, such as ""How do sensory stimuli change over time in a specific location?"" might also be absent.

4. **Cultural or Individual Differences**: Questions that address how sensory stimuli are perceived differently across cultures or individuals, such as ""How do cultural backgrounds influence the perception of smells in a specific place?"" could be essential but missing.

5. **Impact and Reactions**: Questions that delve into the impact of sensory stimuli on behavior or emotions, like ""What emotional responses are triggered by specific sensory stimuli in urban environments?"" may also be lacking.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from a broader range of questions that encompass various aspects of sensory experiences, including context, comparison, temporal changes, cultural influences, and emotional impacts. This would enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions and ensure that they cover essential areas of inquiry related to sensory stimuli.",[0.2949668765068054],0.2949668765068054,Which smells are associated with [specific place e.g. the Amsterdam stock exchange]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]","What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific stimulus generation event, and what material substantial sources are associated with these stimuli?",0.2949668765068054,0.6136816740036011

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience in a cultural heritage context?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are associated with [a city e.g. London]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.30
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic space (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity). The low Jaccard score suggests that the overlap in vocabulary is minimal, but the cosine similarity indicates that the questions may be conceptually related in terms of their focus on sensory experiences.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and themes present in the generated CQs compared to the manual ones. 

**Key Observations**:
- The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory experiences, cultural heritage contexts, and the relationship between stimuli and perception.
- The manual CQs appear to be more general and may not cover the nuanced aspects of sensory experiences in cultural contexts.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Cultural Context of Sensory Experiences**: Questions that explore how different cultures interpret or experience sensory stimuli (e.g., ""How do different cultures perceive the same sensory stimuli?"").
2. **Temporal Aspects of Sensory Experiences**: Questions that investigate how sensory experiences change over time or in different contexts (e.g., ""How do sensory experiences evolve during a cultural event?"").
3. **Comparative Sensory Experiences**: Questions that compare sensory experiences across different locations or events (e.g., ""What are the differences in sensory stimuli experienced in urban vs. rural cultural heritage sites?"").
4. **Impact of Sensory Stimuli on Memory**: Questions that delve into how sensory experiences influence memory and perception in cultural heritage contexts (e.g., ""How do specific sensory stimuli trigger memories of cultural heritage events?"").

These missing CQs highlight the need for a more comprehensive exploration of sensory experiences, particularly in relation to cultural heritage, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. The generated CQs suggest a deeper inquiry into the interplay between sensory perception and cultural context, which could enhance the overall understanding of the subject matter.",[0.30346402525901794],0.30346402525901794,Which smells are associated with [a city e.g. London]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience in a cultural heritage context?,0.30346402525901794,0.5921663641929626

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are associated with [a region OR country e.g Sussex OR France]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.25
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00
- **BERTScore-F1**: Not explicitly provided for this pair, but the average BERTScore-F1 across all pairs is 0.54.
- **BLEU**: 0.00
- **ROUGE-L F1**: 0.06

This pair stands out as the only one with a cosine similarity of 0.25, which is the maximum similarity observed across all pairs. However, the Jaccard similarity is 0.00, indicating that there are no common words between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share lexical similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their sources suggests a focus on the relationship between sensory experiences and their origins. If the manual list lacks questions that explore sensory perceptions (e.g., ""What sensory experiences are linked to specific environmental factors?""), this could be a significant gap.
  
2. **Material Sources**: The generated CQ also mentions ""material substantial,"" which implies a focus on the physical sources of sensory stimuli. If the manual list does not include questions about the origins of materials or substances related to sensory experiences (e.g., ""What materials are commonly used to create specific sensory stimuli?""), this could be another missing area.

3. **Regional Associations**: The manual CQ about smells associated with regions suggests a geographical aspect. If the generated CQs include broader or different geographical contexts (e.g., ""How do sensory stimuli vary across different cultures or regions?""), this could indicate a missing dimension in the manual list.

4. **Event-Driven Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ references ""stimulus generation events,"" which may imply a focus on specific occurrences that lead to sensory experiences. If the manual list lacks questions about events that trigger sensory perceptions (e.g., ""What events lead to the generation of specific sensory stimuli?""), this could represent an essential area that is not covered.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that address sensory experiences, material sources, regional associations, and event-driven sensory phenomena, which are reflected in the generated CQs but not explicitly captured in the manual list.",[0.2455330193042755],0.2455330193042755,Which smells are associated with [a region OR country e.g Sussex OR France]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.2455330193042755,0.5395384430885315

- **Manual CQ**: ""In which kind of places was possible to perceive [smell source, e.g. incense]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.44
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.44, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity based on the vector representation of the questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which may indicate that while the questions are conceptually related, they do not share specific vocabulary.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the context of cultural heritage and sensory experiences. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity and the absence of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover aspects that are not fully represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Focus**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli indicates a focus on how different materials in cultural heritage contexts can evoke sensory experiences. This aspect may not be adequately captured in the manual list, which seems to focus more on specific instances of sensory perception (e.g., smell from incense).

2. **Material Interaction**: The generated CQ emphasizes the interaction between material substances and sensory stimuli, which could lead to questions about how different materials (e.g., wood, stone, textiles) contribute to sensory experiences in cultural heritage. This broader inquiry may be missing from the manual list.

3. **Cultural Context**: The generated CQ mentions ""cultural heritage contexts,"" suggesting a need for questions that explore the significance of sensory experiences in different cultural settings. Questions that address how cultural practices influence sensory perception may be absent.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: There may be a lack of questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultural heritage sites or materials, which could provide valuable insights into the role of sensory stimuli in cultural identity.

5. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions that consider how sensory experiences related to cultural heritage have changed over time or how they are perceived by different generations could also be missing.

In summary, while the manual list may contain specific instances of sensory perception, it appears to lack broader, more conceptual questions that explore the relationship between material substances, sensory experiences, and cultural heritage contexts. This gap suggests an opportunity to enrich the manual list with additional CQs that address these essential themes.",[0.444155752658844],0.444155752658844,"In which kind of places was possible to perceive [smell source, e.g. incense]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific material substances in cultural heritage contexts?,0.444155752658844,0.5983308553695679

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific stimulus generation events and how are they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""In which kind of places was possible to perceive [smell, e.g. floreal]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.41**, which is the maximum score recorded among all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is **0.00**, indicating that there are no common words between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share specific vocabulary.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low average similarity scores across various metrics (e.g., Jaccard similarity of **0.00**, BLEU score of **0.00**, and ROUGE-L F1 of **0.06**), it indicates that the generated CQs are likely exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list.

Some potential essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list, based on the generated CQs, might include:

1. **Exploration of Sensory Experiences**: Questions that delve into how different sensory stimuli (beyond just smell) are perceived in various contexts, particularly in cultural heritage. For example:
   - ""How do visual stimuli influence the perception of cultural heritage sites?""
   - ""What role does auditory perception play in experiencing cultural heritage?""

2. **Cultural Contexts**: Questions that focus on the cultural implications of sensory experiences. For example:
   - ""How do different cultures interpret sensory stimuli in heritage contexts?""
   - ""What are the cultural significances of specific sensory experiences in heritage sites?""

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultural heritage contexts. For example:
   - ""How do sensory perceptions differ between urban and rural cultural heritage sites?""

4. **Impact of Technology**: Questions that consider the impact of technology on sensory experiences in cultural heritage. For example:
   - ""How does virtual reality alter the perception of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage?""

5. **Temporal Changes**: Questions that address how sensory perceptions of cultural heritage may change over time. For example:
   - ""How have perceptions of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage evolved over the last century?""

These examples illustrate the potential breadth of inquiry that could be included in the manual list to ensure a comprehensive exploration of sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts. The generated CQs suggest a wider range of topics and angles that may not be fully represented in the manual list, indicating areas for further development and inclusion.",[0.4053465723991394],0.4053465723991394,"In which kind of places was possible to perceive [smell, e.g. floreal]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific stimulus generation events and how are they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.4053465723991394,0.5634523630142212

- **Manual CQ**: ""In which kind of places was possible to perceive both [floreal smells] a [woody smell]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.39
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.07

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.39, which indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.07 suggests that there is a very low overlap in the actual terms used in the questions, indicating that while the questions may be conceptually related, they differ significantly in their wording and specific focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low precision and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. For example, questions that ask about the nature of specific sensory experiences or the conditions under which they occur could be missing.

2. **Contextual Situations**: The generated CQs may include inquiries about specific events or contexts in which sensory stimuli are perceived, which might not be present in the manual list. This could include questions about the environmental or situational factors influencing sensory perception.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQs might also include comparative questions that explore differences or similarities between various sensory stimuli or experiences, which may not be captured in the manual list.

4. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions that address the timing or duration of sensory experiences could also be missing. For instance, inquiries about how sensory perception changes over time or in different phases of an event.

5. **Material Sources**: The generated CQ mentions ""material substantial"" as a source of sensory stimuli, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list. Questions that explore the origins or materials contributing to sensory experiences could be an essential area that is overlooked.

In summary, while the manual list may cover some fundamental aspects of sensory stimuli, the generated CQs suggest a broader range of inquiries that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions. It would be beneficial to review the generated CQs in detail to identify specific themes or topics that are underrepresented in the manual list.",[0.3895328640937805],0.3895328640937805,In which kind of places was possible to perceive both [floreal smells] a [woody smell]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 3, 'Average': 3.3333333333333335}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was its source?,0.3895328640937805,0.5356184840202332
0.5901633501052856,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of these stimuli?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smell was possible to perceive during a [general event, e.g. a war]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.49** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.06**. The cosine similarity score indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar overall. The Jaccard similarity score is very low, suggesting that the overlap in unique terms between the two questions is minimal.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.49) and the fact that no matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 were found, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Some potential essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list, based on the generated CQs, might include:

- **Questions about sensory modalities**: The generated CQ emphasizes sensory stimuli, which may include not just smell but also sight, sound, touch, and taste. Manual CQs may be lacking questions that explore these other sensory experiences in relation to events.
  
- **Questions about the source of stimuli**: The generated CQ mentions the ""material substantial"" as the source of stimuli, which could lead to questions about the origins of sensory experiences in various contexts (e.g., ""What materials contributed to the sensory experiences during a specific event?"").

- **Questions about the context of events**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which suggests a need for questions that explore the context and conditions under which sensory stimuli are perceived (e.g., ""What were the conditions that influenced sensory perceptions during a specific historical event?"").

- **Questions about the interaction of multiple stimuli**: The generated CQ implies a complexity in sensory experiences that may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that explore how different sensory stimuli interact or influence each other could be essential (e.g., ""How did visual and auditory stimuli interact during a specific event?"").

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that address a broader range of sensory experiences, the sources of those experiences, the context of events, and the interactions between different types of stimuli. These aspects could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs and align them more closely with the generated CQs.",[0.4918031096458435],0.4918031096458435,"Which smell was possible to perceive during a [general event, e.g. a war]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of these stimuli?,0.4918031096458435,0.5901633501052856

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.43
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.43, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which is indicative of a lack of overlap in vocabulary despite some conceptual similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli encompasses a wider range of sensory experiences (sight, sound, touch, etc.) in cultural heritage contexts, which may not be fully captured by the manual CQ focused solely on smell.
   
2. **Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ emphasizes the perception of stimuli in cultural heritage contexts, which may include historical, social, and emotional dimensions that are not addressed in the manual list.

3. **Specific Events and Their Impact**: The generated CQ suggests an inquiry into how specific events influence sensory perception, which could lead to questions about the impact of historical events on collective memory and sensory experiences.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a comparative analysis of different sensory stimuli across various events, which may not be present in the manual list.

5. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at interdisciplinary connections between sensory studies, cultural heritage, and historical events, suggesting that manual CQs may lack a holistic view of these intersections.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that explore broader sensory experiences, cultural contexts, the impact of specific events, comparative analyses, and interdisciplinary connections. These aspects could enrich the inquiry into sensory perception in cultural heritage and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.",[0.4311116933822632],0.4311116933822632,"Which smell was possible to perceive during the [specific event, e.g. Crimean War]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and how were they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.4311116933822632,0.5916286110877991

- **Manual CQ**: ""Which kind of event produced an increment of smell experiences?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.58
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.04

This pair exhibits the maximum cosine similarity of 0.58, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions. However, the Jaccard similarity is very low (0.04), suggesting that while the questions may share some conceptual overlap, they differ significantly in terms of the specific words and phrases used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.04) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Focus**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours indicates a focus on sensory experiences that may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This suggests a gap in exploring how different materials contribute to sensory experiences in cultural heritage contexts.

2. **Cultural Heritage Context**: The generated CQ emphasizes the relationship between materials and cultural heritage, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. This could indicate a need for questions that explore the significance of materials in cultural heritage beyond just sensory experiences.

3. **Event-Driven Experiences**: The manual CQ focuses on events that produce smell experiences, which may overlook other types of sensory stimuli or experiences that can arise from different contexts or materials. This suggests a need for questions that explore various types of sensory experiences beyond just smell.

4. **Material-Specific Questions**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific material,"" indicating a potential need for questions that delve into the characteristics and impacts of particular materials in cultural heritage, which may not be present in the manual list.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals that the only pair with the highest similarity is between a generated CQ and a manual CQ, both focusing on sensory experiences but differing significantly in wording. Additionally, there are essential CQs related to sensory experiences, cultural heritage, event-driven experiences, and material specificity that appear to be missing from the manual list, indicating areas for further exploration and inclusion.",[0.5835776329040527],0.5835776329040527,Which kind of event produced an increment of smell experiences?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.5835776329040527,0.65101158618927
0.6607146263122559,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which kind of event produced a reduction of smell experiences?""

This pair has a cosine similarity score of **0.63**, which is the maximum cosine similarity observed across all pairs. The Jaccard similarity for this pair is notably low at **0.04**, indicating that while the semantic content of the questions is similar, the overlap in terms of shared words or phrases is minimal. 

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the average cosine similarity of **0.63** and the high precision at a threshold of **0.6**, it suggests that the generated CQs are closely aligned with the manual ones, but there may still be gaps in coverage.

**Potential Missing CQs:**
- **Diversity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQs may include questions that explore a wider range of sensory experiences beyond just smell, such as taste, touch, sight, and sound in the context of cultural heritage. If the manual list is focused primarily on smell, it may miss out on the holistic sensory experience.
  
- **Cultural Context**: Questions that delve into how different cultures perceive and interpret sensory stimuli could be missing. For example, ""How do different cultures interpret the sensory experiences associated with specific odours?""

- **Temporal Changes**: CQs that address how sensory experiences change over time or in different contexts (e.g., ""How do sensory experiences related to cultural heritage odours evolve with changing societal norms?"") might not be present.

- **Impact of Events**: While the manual CQ touches on events that reduce smell experiences, there may be a lack of questions that explore events that enhance or alter sensory experiences, such as festivals or rituals.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare sensory experiences across different cultural heritage contexts or between different sensory modalities could also be missing. For example, ""How do sensory experiences of odours compare to those of visual stimuli in cultural heritage settings?""

In summary, while the generated CQs show a strong semantic alignment with the manual CQs, there may be essential questions related to the diversity of sensory experiences, cultural context, temporal changes, and comparative analyses that are not adequately represented in the manual list.",[0.6297109127044678],0.6297109127044678,Which kind of event produced a reduction of smell experiences?,1.0,1,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory experiences associated with specific sensory stimuli in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.6297109127044678,0.6607146263122559

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was involved as the source or carrier of these stimuli?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What are the adjectives used for [smell, e.g. orange aroma] in the 15th century?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.31** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.06**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is quite low, indicating minimal shared terms or concepts.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list. 

Here are some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing:

- **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific events and sensory stimuli, which may indicate a need for broader questions that explore the historical, cultural, or scientific context of sensory experiences. For example, questions about how sensory perceptions have evolved over time or how they are documented in various cultures could be valuable.

- **Comparative Questions**: There may be a lack of questions that compare different sensory stimuli or their representations across different time periods or cultures. For instance, questions like ""How did the representation of smell differ between the 15th century and the modern era?"" could provide deeper insights.

- **Methodological Questions**: Questions that address the methods used to study or document sensory experiences might be missing. For example, ""What methodologies were employed to analyze sensory stimuli in historical texts?"" could be an essential addition.

- **Interdisciplinary Questions**: Given the nature of sensory studies, questions that bridge disciplines (e.g., psychology, anthropology, history) could be beneficial. An example could be, ""How do psychological theories of perception inform our understanding of historical sensory descriptions?""

In summary, while the manual list may contain specific and focused questions, the generated CQs suggest a broader and more diverse range of inquiries that could enhance the understanding of sensory stimuli and their historical context. Addressing these gaps could lead to a more comprehensive set of competency questions.",[0.31450507044792175],0.31450507044792175,"What are the adjectives used for [smell, e.g. orange aroma] in the 15th century?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was involved as the source or carrier of these stimuli?,0.31450507044792175,0.5291349291801453
0.5648206472396851,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which painter was portraying more [smell, e.g. smoky]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.40
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the cosine similarity is relatively low (0.40), it is the highest among all pairs compared. The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which is consistent with the nature of cosine similarity focusing on the angle between vectors rather than their exact overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the context and content of the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are likely exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not captured in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage suggests a focus on the sensory experiences associated with materials, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This could include questions about how different materials evoke specific sensory responses or the role of smell in cultural heritage.

2. **Cultural Context**: The generated CQ emphasizes the context of cultural heritage, which may imply a need for questions that explore the significance of sensory experiences in cultural practices, rituals, or historical contexts.

3. **Artistic Representation**: The manual CQ about painters and smell hints at an artistic interpretation of sensory experiences. There may be a gap in questions that explore how different artists or art movements represent sensory experiences, particularly in relation to smell and other senses.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ suggests a potential interdisciplinary approach, linking sensory studies with cultural heritage. Questions that bridge art, history, and sensory perception may be missing from the manual list.

5. **Material Properties**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific material,"" indicating a focus on the properties of materials themselves and how they relate to sensory experiences. Questions that delve into the characteristics of materials and their sensory implications could be essential.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in questions that address sensory experiences, cultural contexts, artistic representations, interdisciplinary connections, and material properties related to sensory stimuli in cultural heritage. These areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions and provide a more holistic understanding of the topic.",[0.40025660395622253],0.40025660395622253,"Which painter was portraying more [smell, e.g. smoky]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odours?,0.40025660395622253,0.5648206472396851
0.5112007856369019,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which country was portraying more [smell, e.g. smoky]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.28
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic space (as indicated by the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity). The low Jaccard score suggests that the overlap in vocabulary is minimal, which is further supported by the fact that the maximum and average values for Jaccard similarity across all pairs are both 0.00.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low similarity scores, it appears that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs. 

**Key Observations**:
- The average cosine similarity of 0.28 indicates that there is some level of semantic similarity, but it is relatively low, suggesting that the generated CQs may be exploring different aspects or dimensions of the topic than those covered in the manual list.
- The absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6 indicates that none of the generated CQs closely align with the manual CQs, which could imply that the manual list is missing a broader range of questions that could be relevant to the topic.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. Questions that explore the relationship between sensory experiences and broader contexts (e.g., cultural or environmental factors) may be missing.
   
2. **Comparative Questions**: The manual CQ about countries and sensory portrayal suggests a comparative angle that may not be fully explored in the generated CQs. Questions that compare different stimuli across various contexts or events could be essential.

3. **Mechanistic Questions**: Questions that delve into the mechanisms of how sensory stimuli are generated or perceived may also be absent. For example, inquiries into the psychological or physiological processes involved in sensory perception could be valuable.

4. **Temporal or Situational Questions**: Questions that consider the timing or situational context of sensory experiences (e.g., ""How do sensory stimuli change over time in response to specific events?"") may also be lacking.

In summary, the generated CQs appear to cover different aspects of sensory stimuli that are not reflected in the manual list, indicating that essential questions related to broader contexts, comparisons, mechanisms, and temporal factors may be missing.",[0.2772490084171295],0.2772490084171295,"Which country was portraying more [smell, e.g. smoky]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources?,0.2772490084171295,0.5112007856369019
0.5099701285362244,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The only pair that has been identified with the highest similarity is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which part of the place [town, countryside, market] is portrayed with the most smell?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.26
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the maximum cosine similarity of 0.26 among all pairs analyzed. However, it is important to note that the Jaccard similarity is 0.00, indicating that there are no common words or phrases between the two questions. This suggests that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share lexical similarity.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we need to consider the following:

- **Diversity of Topics**: The generated CQs may cover a broader range of topics or specific aspects of sensory experiences that are not represented in the manual list.
- **Depth of Inquiry**: The generated CQs might delve into specific sensory modalities, processes, or contexts that are not captured in the manual CQs.

Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.26) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that the generated CQs are likely exploring different angles or dimensions of the subject matter compared to the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specific Sensory Modalities**: Questions focusing on individual senses (e.g., ""How does visual perception influence the interpretation of auditory stimuli?"").
2. **Contextual Factors**: Questions that consider environmental or situational contexts (e.g., ""In what settings do certain sensory stimuli evoke stronger emotional responses?"").
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Questions that compare different sensory experiences (e.g., ""How do sensory experiences differ between urban and rural environments?"").
4. **Temporal Aspects**: Questions that address changes over time (e.g., ""How does sensory perception evolve during different stages of a sensory experience?"").

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in CQs that explore these diverse and nuanced aspects of sensory experiences, which are likely present in the generated CQs. This indicates a need for a more comprehensive approach to ensure that all relevant dimensions of the topic are covered.",[0.2636339068412781],0.2636339068412781,"Which part of the place [town, countryside, maket] is portrayed with the most smell?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.2636339068412781,0.5099701285362244

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.29** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.03**. The cosine similarity indicates that while there is some overlap in the vector representation of the two questions, it is relatively low, suggesting that the questions are not closely aligned in terms of their semantic content. The Jaccard similarity further confirms this, as it is quite low, indicating minimal shared elements between the two questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not addressed in the manual list. 

Here are some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing:

- **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on specific sensory stimuli and their sources, which may not be fully captured in the manual list. Questions that explore the broader context of sensory experiences, such as how different stimuli interact or influence perception, could be missing.

- **Comparative Questions**: The generated CQs may include comparative elements, such as asking how different types of stimuli (visual, auditory, olfactory) are perceived in various contexts. If the manual list lacks such comparative questions, it could be a significant gap.

- **Temporal or Situational Questions**: Questions that address the timing or situational context of sensory experiences (e.g., ""How do sensory stimuli change over time during an event?"") may not be present in the manual list.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQs might touch on interdisciplinary aspects, such as the relationship between sensory stimuli and emotional responses or cognitive processes, which may not be reflected in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore broader contexts, comparisons, temporal dynamics, and interdisciplinary connections related to sensory stimuli and their perception. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list could help identify specific questions that fill these gaps.",[0.2928704023361206],0.2928704023361206,"In which part of an image [foreground, middleground, background] are smells portrayed?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was involved as the source or carrier of these stimuli?,0.2928704023361206,0.5512438416481018

The BERTScore-F1 of 0.49 indicates that there is some semantic overlap, but it is not particularly strong.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.34) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Stimuli and Their Sources**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli and their sources indicates a focus on the origins and carriers of sensory experiences, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
2. **Temporal Changes in Sensory Perception**: The manual CQ regarding the portrayal of smells over time suggests a historical or developmental perspective, but the generated CQ's focus on specific events and their sensory outputs may not be captured.
3. **Event-Driven Sensory Analysis**: The generated CQ emphasizes the relationship between specific stimulus generation events and sensory stimuli, which may not be addressed in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that explore the relationships between sensory stimuli, their sources, and the impact of specific events on sensory perception. The generated CQs seem to introduce dimensions of inquiry that are not fully represented in the manual list, indicating a potential gap in the coverage of essential topics related to sensory experiences.",[0.33824509382247925],0.33824509382247925,"Which portrayal of a smell [pomander, tobacco] changed [disappeared/faded/developed] over time?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their sources and carriers?,0.33824509382247925,0.48890623450279236

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.28
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content (as reflected in the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The cosine similarity of 0.28 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but the lack of overlap in terms means they are fundamentally different in structure and focus.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average cosine similarity (0.28) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli indicates a focus on the sources and carriers of stimuli, which may not be addressed in the manual list. This suggests a gap in exploring the origins and contexts of sensory experiences.
  
2. **Event Contextualization**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific stimulus generation event,"" which implies a need for questions that explore the context or circumstances under which sensory stimuli are generated. This could be a critical area of inquiry that is not captured in the manual list.

3. **Comparative Analysis of Sensory Inputs**: The generated CQ hints at a comparative analysis of different sensory stimuli, which may not be present in the manual list. Questions that ask for comparisons or contrasts between different types of sensory stimuli could be essential.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ suggests a potential interdisciplinary approach by linking sensory stimuli to their sources and carriers. This could imply a need for questions that explore connections between sensory experiences and other fields (e.g., psychology, neuroscience, literature).

5. **Quantitative Aspects of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ's focus on ""what were their sources and carriers"" may imply a quantitative aspect that is missing from the manual list. Questions that quantify sensory experiences or their impacts could be valuable.

In summary, the manual list may be lacking in specificity regarding the sources and contexts of sensory stimuli, comparative analyses, interdisciplinary connections, and quantitative inquiries related to sensory experiences. These areas could be explored further to enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs.",[0.2758754789829254],0.2758754789829254,"In which text we can find [smell, e.g. citrus]?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what were their sources and carriers?,0.2758754789829254,0.5178050994873047
0.6279529929161072,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual CQs is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific instance of stimulus generation and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What scents are associated with [genre of text]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.32** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.10**. The cosine similarity indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content, they are not highly similar. The Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is also low, suggesting that the questions differ significantly in their specific wording and focus.

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we would typically analyze the generated CQs for themes, topics, or specific inquiries that are not represented in the manual list. However, since the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided beyond the highest similarity pair, we can infer some general areas that might be missing based on the statistics:

- **Sensory Experience**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli suggests a focus on sensory experiences, which may not be adequately covered in the manual list. If the manual list lacks questions related to sensory perception, it could be a significant gap.

- **Specificity of Instances**: The generated CQ mentions ""specific instance of stimulus generation,"" indicating a potential need for questions that address particular cases or examples within the broader topic. If the manual list contains more general questions, it may miss out on the nuances of specific instances.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ's reference to ""sensory experience"" could imply a need for questions that connect sensory perception with other fields, such as psychology, neuroscience, or art. If the manual list does not include interdisciplinary questions, this could be another area of omission.

- **Contextual Inquiry**: The generated CQ's complexity suggests a need for questions that explore context, such as the relationship between sensory stimuli and emotional or cognitive responses. If the manual list lacks context-driven inquiries, this could represent a missing element.

In summary, without the complete list of generated CQs, it is challenging to pinpoint specific missing questions. However, the analysis suggests that areas related to sensory experiences, specificity, interdisciplinary connections, and contextual inquiries may be underrepresented in the manual list.

The Jaccard similarity score of 0.13 suggests that there is a low overlap in the unique terms used in both questions, which is consistent with the nature of the questions being related but not identical.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it indicates that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Focus**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts suggests a focus on sensory experiences that may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This could indicate a gap in exploring how different materials evoke sensory responses, particularly in cultural heritage contexts.

2. **Contextual Specificity**: The generated CQ emphasizes the context of ""cultural heritage odour experiences,"" which may not be represented in the manual list. This suggests a potential missing area of inquiry regarding how specific cultural artifacts or materials contribute to sensory experiences.

3. **Material and Sensory Interaction**: The generated CQ implies a relationship between materials and sensory stimuli, which may not be captured in the manual list. This could indicate a need for questions that explore the interaction between different materials and the sensory experiences they evoke.

4. **Temporal Aspects of Scents**: The manual CQ mentions ""period of text,"" which may not fully encompass the temporal aspects of how scents and sensory experiences evolve over time. This could be an area where additional questions are needed to explore historical or contextual changes in sensory perceptions.

### Conclusion

In summary, the highest similarity pair is between a generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage and a manual CQ about associated scents. The analysis suggests that essential CQs related to sensory experiences, contextual specificity, material interactions, and temporal aspects of scents may be missing from the manual list, indicating areas for further exploration and inclusion.",[0.49808868765830994],0.49808868765830994,What scents are associated with [period of text]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by a specific material substantial in the context of cultural heritage odour experiences?,0.49808868765830994,0.6812825798988342
0.5599172711372375,"Based on the provided statistics and analysis of the two sets of Competency Questions (CQs), here are the answers to your queries:

### 1. Which pairs have the highest similarity?

The pair with the highest similarity, as indicated by the statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""What scents do [named, country of origin, male/female] authors describe most?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.33** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.04**. The cosine similarity score indicates a low level of semantic similarity, suggesting that while there may be some overlap in the topics addressed (both involve sensory stimuli), the specific focus and wording differ significantly. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential CQs are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low average cosine similarity (0.33) and the lack of matches with a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not adequately represented in the manual list.

While the specific content of the generated CQs is not provided, we can infer that the following types of questions might be missing from the manual list based on the context of the generated CQ:

- **Questions about the relationship between sensory stimuli and their sources**: The generated CQ emphasizes the connection between sensory stimuli and their material sources or carriers, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
  
- **Questions focusing on specific types of sensory experiences**: The generated CQ mentions ""sensory stimuli,"" which could encompass a broader range of sensory experiences (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) that may not be represented in the manual list.

- **Questions related to the context of stimulus generation events**: The mention of ""specific stimulus generation events"" in the generated CQ suggests a focus on the circumstances or contexts in which sensory stimuli are produced, which may be absent in the manual CQs.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that explore the broader context of sensory experiences, the relationship between stimuli and their sources, and specific types of sensory stimuli beyond just scents. To identify the exact missing CQs, a detailed comparison of the content of both sets would be necessary.",[0.3252550959587097],0.3252550959587097,"What scents do [named, country of origin, male/female] authors describe most?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.3252550959587097,0.5599172711372375
0.5074689984321594,"### 1. Pairs with the Highest Similarity

The pair with the highest similarity between the generated and manual Competency Questions (CQs) is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""In which paintings is [smell, e.g. citrus] present?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.34
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the two questions share some semantic content (as reflected in the cosine similarity), they do not share any common terms or phrases (as indicated by the Jaccard similarity of 0.00). The cosine similarity of 0.34 suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity, but the lack of overlap in terms means that they are not closely aligned in terms of specific vocabulary.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the statistics provided, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are not closely aligned with the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Sensory Context**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli encompasses a broader range of sensory experiences (beyond just smell) and their sources. This suggests that manual CQs may be missing questions that explore other sensory modalities (e.g., taste, touch, sound) in relation to artworks or stimuli.
  
2. **Material Sources of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes the material sources or carriers of sensory stimuli, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual CQs. This could indicate a gap in exploring the relationship between the medium of art and the sensory experiences it evokes.

3. **Specificity of Events**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which implies a focus on particular instances or contexts in which sensory experiences are generated. This specificity may not be captured in the manual CQs, which could be more general.

4. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach by linking sensory experiences to events and material sources. Manual CQs may lack questions that connect art with other fields such as psychology, neuroscience, or environmental studies.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that address broader sensory experiences, the materiality of stimuli, specific events, and interdisciplinary connections. These aspects could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual CQs and align them more closely with the generated CQs.",[0.3383731245994568],0.3383731245994568,"In which paintings is [smell, e.g. citrus] present?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and what were their material sources or carriers?,0.3383731245994568,0.5074689984321594

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and perceived as part of sensory experiences within the context of cultural heritage?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which paintings show [pleasant, unpleasant] smells?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.40
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This indicates that while the cosine similarity is relatively low (0.40), it is the highest among all pairs compared. The Jaccard similarity being 0.00 suggests that there are no common terms between the two questions, which is consistent with the nature of cosine similarity focusing on the angle between vectors rather than their overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low average Jaccard similarity (0.00) and the absence of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs are significantly different in wording and possibly in focus from the manual CQs.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Broader Contextual Questions**: The generated CQs seem to focus on sensory experiences and cultural heritage, which may not be adequately represented in the manual list. Questions that explore the relationship between sensory stimuli and cultural artifacts could be missing.
   
2. **Specific Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes sensory stimuli and experiences, which may not be captured in the manual list. Questions that delve into specific sensory modalities (e.g., taste, touch) in relation to cultural heritage could be essential.

3. **Temporal or Event-Based Questions**: The generated CQ mentions ""stimulus generation events,"" indicating a focus on the timing and context of sensory experiences. Questions that explore how sensory experiences change over time or in response to specific events may be lacking.

4. **Comparative Questions**: The generated CQ suggests a comparative analysis of different sensory stimuli within cultural contexts. Questions that compare different types of sensory experiences or their impacts on cultural heritage may be missing.

5. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQs may also touch on interdisciplinary aspects, such as the intersection of art, psychology, and sensory perception, which may not be fully represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may benefit from incorporating questions that explore broader contexts, specific sensory experiences, temporal dynamics, comparative analyses, and interdisciplinary connections related to cultural heritage and sensory stimuli.",[0.39969462156295776],0.39969462156295776,"Which paintings show [pleasant, unpleasant] smells?",0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and perceived as part of sensory experiences within the context of cultural heritage?,0.39969462156295776,0.5166046619415283

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which kind of reactions to smells are possible to find in [Dutch] paintings of [18th century]?""

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.36
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.00

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity score of 0.36 among all pairs analyzed. However, the Jaccard similarity score of 0.00 indicates that there are no common terms between the two questions, suggesting that while the questions may be conceptually related, they do not share any lexical overlap.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience Context**: The generated CQ emphasizes the process of sensory stimulus generation and perception, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This could indicate a gap in exploring how sensory experiences are generated and perceived in various contexts, such as art or literature.

2. **Specificity of Sensory Stimuli**: The generated CQ refers to ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which suggests a focus on particular instances or types of sensory stimuli. If the manual list lacks questions that delve into specific types of sensory stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory), this could be a significant omission.

3. **Reactions to Sensory Stimuli**: The manual CQ focuses on reactions to smells in a specific cultural context (Dutch paintings of the 18th century). However, the generated CQ's broader inquiry into sensory experiences may indicate a lack of questions addressing reactions to various sensory stimuli across different contexts or mediums.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The generated CQ implies a potential for comparative analysis of sensory experiences across different events or stimuli. If the manual list does not include questions that facilitate such comparisons, this could represent another area that is underexplored.

### Conclusion

In summary, the highest similarity pair is between a generated CQ about sensory stimuli and a manual CQ about reactions to smells in paintings, with a notable lack of lexical overlap. The analysis suggests that essential CQs related to the generation and perception of sensory experiences, specificity of stimuli, and comparative analyses may be missing from the manual list. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions.",[0.36078059673309326],0.36078059673309326,Which kind of reactions to smells are possible to find in [Dutch] paintings of [18th century]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.333333333333333}]",What sensory stimulus was generated by a specific stimulus generation event and perceived during a sensory experience?,0.36078059673309326,0.5070313811302185

**Similarity Metrics**:
- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.45
- **Jaccard Similarity**: 0.08

This pair exhibits the highest cosine similarity of 0.45 among all pairs analyzed, indicating a moderate level of semantic similarity. However, the Jaccard similarity is quite low at 0.08, suggesting that while the two questions may share some conceptual overlap, they differ significantly in terms of the specific terms and structure used.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the statistics, particularly the low precision and lack of matches with cosine similarity ≥ 0.6, it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not adequately represented in the manual list.

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experiences in Cultural Heritage**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts indicates a focus on the intersection of sensory perception and cultural heritage, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list.
  
2. **Specificity of Stimuli**: The generated CQ emphasizes ""specific stimulus generation events,"" which suggests a need for questions that delve into particular types of stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory) and their effects on perception, which may be absent in the manual list.

3. **Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ's focus on cultural heritage implies that there may be a lack of questions addressing how different cultures perceive and react to sensory stimuli, which could be an essential area of inquiry.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: The generated CQs may also suggest a need for questions that integrate insights from psychology, art history, and sensory studies, which might not be fully represented in the manual list.

In summary, the manual list may be missing CQs that explore the nuances of sensory experiences, the specificity of stimuli, cultural contexts, and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding sensory perception in relation to cultural heritage. These areas could enhance the comprehensiveness of the competency questions and ensure a broader exploration of the topic.",[0.4498230814933777],0.4498230814933777,What sort of people react to smells in paintings?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by specific stimulus generation events and perceived during sensory experiences in a cultural heritage context?,0.4498230814933777,0.5785356163978577

The pair with the highest similarity, based on the provided statistics, is:

- **Generated CQ**: ""What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of these stimuli?""
- **Manual CQ**: ""Which smells are possible to find in paintings of the [Rijksmuseum]?""

This pair has a cosine similarity of **0.31** and a Jaccard similarity of **0.07**. The cosine similarity indicates a moderate level of semantic similarity between the two questions, while the Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of unique terms, is quite low. This suggests that while the questions may share some conceptual ground (both relate to sensory experiences), they differ significantly in their specific content and phrasing.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can consider the following aspects:

- **Diversity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQs seem to focus on a broader range of sensory stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory). If the manual list primarily addresses visual aspects (like paintings), it may lack questions that explore other sensory modalities, such as sound or touch.

- **Contextual and Situational Queries**: The generated CQs include questions about specific events or contexts (e.g., ""stimulus generation event""). If the manual list does not include questions that consider the context in which sensory experiences occur, it may be missing essential inquiries that could provide deeper insights.

- **Material and Source Exploration**: The generated CQ mentions ""material substantial"" as a source of stimuli. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the origins or materials of sensory experiences, it may lack depth in understanding how different materials contribute to sensory perception.

- **Comparative Questions**: The generated CQs may include comparative or relational questions (e.g., comparing different types of stimuli or experiences). If the manual list is more focused on singular experiences, it may miss out on the richness of comparative analysis.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore a wider range of sensory modalities, contextual factors, material sources, and comparative analyses. To enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list, it would be beneficial to include questions that address these areas.",[0.31491127610206604],0.31491127610206604,Which smells are possible to find in paintings of the [Rijksmuseum]?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 4, 'Clarity': 3, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]",What sensory stimuli were generated by a specific stimulus generation event and what material substantial was the source of these stimuli?,0.31491127610206604,0.5446614027023315

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low average similarities across various metrics (cosine, Jaccard, BLEU, ROUGE-L), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not represented in the manual list.

Some potential essential CQs that could be missing from the manual list might include:

- **Questions about the relationship between sensory stimuli and emotional responses**: For example, ""How do different sensory stimuli influence emotional responses in various contexts?""
  
- **Questions focusing on the categorization of sensory experiences**: For example, ""What categories of sensory stimuli are most commonly referenced in literature compared to visual art?""

- **Questions exploring the impact of cultural context on sensory perception**: For example, ""How do cultural differences affect the perception of sensory stimuli in art and literature?""

- **Questions regarding the historical evolution of sensory representation**: For example, ""How has the representation of sensory stimuli in texts evolved over different literary periods?""

These examples illustrate areas that may not be fully addressed by the manual CQs but are relevant to the broader understanding of sensory stimuli in various contexts. The generated CQs seem to explore more complex relationships and broader themes, which could indicate gaps in the manual list that could be filled to enhance its comprehensiveness. 

In summary, while the manual list may cover some fundamental aspects, the generated CQs suggest a need for a more diverse range of questions that explore the nuances and complexities of sensory stimuli in literature and art.",[0.31005263328552246],0.31005263328552246,Which smells are frequently present in texts but not in paintings?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 3, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 4, 'Average': 3.6666666666666665}]","What sensory stimuli were generated by specific instances of stimulus generation, and what material substantial sources were involved in these processes?",0.31005263328552246,0.5662202835083008

This pair represents the only instance where the cosine similarity reached its maximum value of 0.31, indicating a relatively low level of semantic similarity between the two questions. The Jaccard similarity is also quite low at 0.06, suggesting that there is minimal overlap in the terms used in both questions.

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual ones. Given the low similarity scores, it is likely that the generated CQs cover different aspects or dimensions of the topic that are not addressed in the manual list. 

**Potential Missing CQs**:
1. **Sensory Experience in Cultural Contexts**: The generated CQ emphasizes the sensory stimuli and their perception in cultural heritage contexts, which may not be explicitly covered in the manual list. This suggests a gap in exploring how sensory experiences are articulated and understood within cultural frameworks.

2. **Non-Object Sources of Sensory Information**: The manual CQ focuses on non-object sources (like emotions and virtues) that emit figurative smells. However, the generated CQ raises the question of how sensory stimuli are generated and perceived, which could include a broader range of sensory experiences beyond just olfactory ones.

3. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at interdisciplinary connections between sensory perception and cultural heritage, which may not be fully represented in the manual list. This could include questions about how different disciplines (e.g., psychology, anthropology, art history) interpret sensory experiences.

4. **Temporal and Contextual Variability**: The generated CQ suggests an interest in how sensory stimuli are perceived over time or in different contexts, which may not be captured in the manual list. This could lead to questions about the evolution of sensory perception in cultural heritage.

5. **Emotional and Psychological Dimensions**: The generated CQ implies a connection between sensory stimuli and emotional responses, which may not be explicitly addressed in the manual list. This could lead to questions about how sensory experiences influence emotions and vice versa.

The cosine similarity score indicates a low level of semantic similarity, suggesting that while there may be some overlap in the concepts being addressed (both involve sensory experiences), the specific focus and wording of the questions differ significantly. 

### 2. Which essential CQs are missing from the manual list?

To determine which essential Competency Questions (CQs) are missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs in relation to the manual CQs. Given the low similarity scores across the board (with the highest cosine similarity being only 0.30), it suggests that the generated CQs may cover topics or aspects that are not addressed in the manual list.

Here are some potential areas where essential CQs might be missing from the manual list:

- **Broader Contextual Understanding**: The generated CQ about sensory stimuli in cultural heritage contexts suggests a focus on how sensory experiences are interpreted and understood within specific cultural frameworks. If the manual list does not include questions that explore the intersection of sensory perception and cultural heritage, this could be a significant gap.

- **Specificity of Sensory Experiences**: The generated CQ emphasizes specific sensory stimuli and their perception, which may not be captured in the manual list if it primarily focuses on adjectives or descriptive language without addressing the underlying sensory experiences.

- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The generated CQ hints at an interdisciplinary approach, potentially linking sensory studies with cultural heritage, which may not be reflected in the manual list if it remains within a narrower scope.

- **Methodological Questions**: The generated CQ implies a methodological inquiry into how sensory stimuli are generated and perceived, which may be absent from the manual list if it lacks questions that address the processes or methodologies involved in sensory perception.

In summary, the manual list may be missing essential CQs that explore the broader implications of sensory experiences, their cultural contexts, and the methodologies for understanding these phenomena. A thorough review of the generated CQs against the manual list would be necessary to identify specific questions that are not represented.",[0.3005789518356323],0.3005789518356323,Which adjectives are used to describe figurative smells?,0.0,0,"[{'Relevance': 5, 'Clarity': 4, 'Depth': 5, 'Average': 4.666666666666667}]",What are the sensory stimuli generated by specific stimulus generation events and how are they perceived in cultural heritage contexts?,0.3005789518356323,0.6242159605026245

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that do not have a corresponding manual CQ with a high similarity score. 

From the generated CQs, the following are notable:

- **""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""**  
  This CQ addresses the types of evidence, which is crucial for understanding the methodologies and outcomes of empirical studies. If the manual list lacks a question about the types of evidence, it may miss an important aspect of empirical research.

- **""2. How has empirical research in software engineering evolved over the past twenty-five years?""**  
  This CQ focuses on the evolution of empirical research, which is essential for understanding trends and changes in the field over time. If the manual list does not include a question about the historical development of empirical research, it may overlook significant insights into the progression of the discipline.

- **""4. How is the success of empirical studies measured in the context of software engineering conferences?""**  
  This CQ pertains to the evaluation metrics of empirical studies, which is vital for assessing the impact and quality of research presented at conferences. If the manual list lacks a question regarding the measurement of success, it may miss critical evaluation criteria.

In summary, the essential CQs that appear to be missing from the manual list include inquiries about the types of evidence produced, the evolution of empirical research over time, and the metrics for measuring the success of empirical studies. These questions are fundamental for a comprehensive understanding of empirical software engineering and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.","[0.6198187470436096, 0.6778214573860168, 0.5276497006416321, 0.6611451506614685, 0.7022382616996765]",0.35616129636764526,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that have high cosine similarity scores with the manual CQs. The following generated CQs stand out as potentially essential but are not matched with corresponding manual CQs:

1. **Generated CQ:** ""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""  
   - This CQ addresses the types of evidence, which is a fundamental aspect of empirical studies in software engineering. The manual list lacks a question that specifically focuses on the types of evidence produced.

2. **Generated CQ:** ""2. How has empirical research in software engineering evolved over the past twenty-five years?""  
   - This CQ is significant as it captures the evolution of empirical research, which is crucial for understanding trends and developments in the field. The manual list does not include a question that directly addresses the historical evolution of empirical research.

3. **Generated CQ:** ""4. How is the success of empirical studies measured in the context of software engineering conferences?""  
   - This CQ is important for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of empirical studies, particularly in academic settings. The manual list does not seem to cover the measurement of success in empirical studies.

In summary, the essential CQs that appear to be missing from the manual list include those focusing on the types of evidence produced by empirical studies, the evolution of empirical research over time, and the measurement of success in empirical studies. These topics are critical for a comprehensive understanding of empirical software engineering and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.","[0.6198187470436096, 0.6778214573860168, 0.5276497006416321, 0.6611451506614685, 0.7022382616996765]",0.35616129636764526,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential Competency Questions (CQs) that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that do not have a corresponding high-similarity match in the manual list. 

From the generated CQs, the following questions stand out as potentially essential but are not matched with high similarity in the manual list:

1. **""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""**  
   - This question addresses the types of evidence, which is crucial for understanding the outcomes of empirical studies. The manual list lacks a question that specifically focuses on the nature of evidence produced.

2. **""2. How has empirical research in software engineering evolved over the past twenty-five years?""**  
   - This question is significant for historical analysis and understanding trends in empirical research. The manual list does not seem to cover the evolution of empirical research over time.

3. **""4. How is the success of empirical studies measured in the context of software engineering conferences?""**  
   - This question is important for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of empirical studies, particularly in academic settings. The manual list does not include a question about measuring success.

4. **""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""** (again)  
   - This question appears twice in the generated list, emphasizing its importance. The manual list lacks a focus on the types of evidence, which is a critical aspect of empirical research.

In summary, the essential CQs that appear to be missing from the manual list include those focusing on the types of evidence produced, the evolution of empirical research, and the measurement of success in empirical studies. These questions are vital for a comprehensive understanding of empirical software engineering and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.","[0.6198187470436096, 0.6778214573860168, 0.5276497006416321, 0.6611451506614685, 0.7022382616996765]",0.35616129636764526,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs that may be missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that do not have a corresponding manual CQ with a high similarity score. The generated CQs that stand out include:

1. **""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""**  
   This question addresses the specific types of evidence that empirical studies yield, which is crucial for understanding the outcomes of such research.

2. **""2. How has empirical research in software engineering evolved over the past twenty-five years?""**  
   This CQ is significant as it seeks to understand the historical trends and developments in empirical research within the field, which can inform future research directions.

3. **""4. How is the success of empirical studies measured in the context of software engineering conferences?""**  
   This question is essential for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of empirical studies, particularly in academic settings.

The manual list appears to focus heavily on the authorship and institutional affiliations of empirical studies, which may overlook broader themes such as the types of evidence produced, the evolution of research methodologies, and the metrics for measuring success. Including questions that address these themes would provide a more comprehensive understanding of empirical software engineering research. 

In summary, the missing essential CQs from the manual list include inquiries about the types of evidence produced, the evolution of empirical research, and the measurement of success in empirical studies. These aspects are critical for a holistic view of the field and should be considered for inclusion in the manual list.","[0.6198187470436096, 0.6778214573860168, 0.5276497006416321, 0.6611451506614685, 0.7022382616996765]",0.35616129636764526,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?

### 2. Essential CQs Missing from the Manual List

To identify essential CQs missing from the manual list, we can analyze the generated CQs that do not have a corresponding manual CQ with a high similarity score. The generated CQs that stand out and may represent important areas of inquiry in empirical software engineering include:

1. **""5. What types of evidence are typically produced by empirical software engineering studies?""**  
   - This CQ addresses the nature of evidence in empirical studies, which is crucial for understanding the validity and reliability of findings in software engineering.

2. **""2. How has empirical research in software engineering evolved over the past twenty-five years?""**  
   - This CQ focuses on the historical development of empirical research, which is essential for contextualizing current practices and identifying trends over time.

3. **""4. How is the success of empirical studies measured in the context of software engineering conferences?""**  
   - This CQ pertains to the evaluation metrics of empirical studies, which is vital for assessing the impact and quality of research presented at conferences.

The manual list appears to lack coverage of these critical areas, particularly regarding the types of evidence produced, the evolution of empirical research, and the measurement of success in empirical studies. Addressing these gaps could enhance the comprehensiveness of the manual list of CQs, ensuring that it captures a broader spectrum of inquiry relevant to empirical software engineering.","[0.6198187470436096, 0.6778214573860168, 0.5276497006416321, 0.6611451506614685, 0.7022382616996765]",0.35616129636764526,"How has the proportion of empirical studies evolved over time?
