0.4285714285714285,"1. The pair of Competency Questions (CQs) that have the highest similarity are the generated question ""What is a single case of internal medicine?"" and the manual question ""What are the specialties of a clinical case?"" The similarity between these two questions is measured by two metrics: cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity. The cosine similarity is 0.43, indicating a moderate level of similarity in terms of the angle between the two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The Jaccard similarity is 0.23, indicating that approximately 23% of the total unique words are shared between the two questions.

2. Without the actual list of manual CQs, it's challenging to identify which essential and important CQs are missing. However, generally speaking, in the context of internal medicine, some potential missing CQs could be:
   - ""What are the common diseases treated in internal medicine?""
   - ""What are the diagnostic procedures used in internal medicine?""
   - ""What are the treatment methods in internal medicine?""
   - ""What is the role of an internal medicine doctor in patient care?""
   - ""What are the sub-specialties within internal medicine?""

These questions are essential as they cover the basic knowledge about internal medicine, including the diseases, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, roles of doctors, and sub-specialties, which are all crucial for understanding the field.",,0.4285714285714285,0.23076923076923078,heatmaps\cosine_heatmap_8101181800396701040.png,What are the specialties of a clinical case?,heatmaps\jaccard_heatmap_8101181800396701040.png,What is a single case of internal medicine?

However, it's important to note that the similarity scores are 0.00, which indicates that these pairs are not similar at all. The cosine and Jaccard similarity measures range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity and 0 indicates no similarity.

As for the second question, without knowing the specific context or domain of the CQs, it's challenging to identify which essential and important CQs are missing from the manual CQ list. However, generally, a comprehensive set of CQs should cover all aspects of the domain, including the properties, relationships, constraints, and behaviors of the entities involved. For example, if the domain is about books, the CQs should cover aspects like the author, publication date, genre, etc. If the domain is a study or research, the CQs should cover the research question, methodology, findings, implications, etc.",,0.0,0.0,heatmaps\cosine_heatmap_5492517683194522278.png,Which known projections are compatible with a given answer?,heatmaps\jaccard_heatmap_5492517683194522278.png,What is the purpose of the part organ encyclopedia? ; What is the purpose of the book? ; What is the purpose of the study?

However, it's important to note that the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores for this pair are both 0.00, indicating that these questions are not similar at all in terms of their semantic content.

As for the second question, without the full list of generated and manual CQs, it's impossible to determine which essential and important CQs are missing from the manual list. The missing CQs would depend on the specific domain or topic that these questions are supposed to cover. For example, if the topic is medical research, important CQs might include questions about the methodology of the research, the sample size, the results, etc. If any of these types of questions are missing from the manual list, they could be considered essential and important missing CQs.",,0.0,0.0,heatmaps\cosine_heatmap_4231255864142473307.png,How many distinct disease categories are there?,heatmaps\jaccard_heatmap_4231255864142473307.png,What does Patrizia start her investigation from?

However, it's important to note that the cosine and Jaccard similarity scores are both 0.00, indicating that these questions are not similar at all. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, and a score of 0.00 suggests the vectors are orthogonal or disjoint. Jaccard similarity measures the intersection over the union of two sets, and a score of 0.00 suggests there is no overlap between the sets.

Without knowing the specific context or domain, it's challenging to identify which essential and important CQs are missing from the manual CQ list. However, generally speaking, a comprehensive set of CQs should cover all key aspects of the domain, including definitions, relationships, attributes, and operations. For example, if the domain is healthcare, important CQs might include ""What are the symptoms of each disease?"" or ""What treatments are available for each disease?""

As for the second question, it's difficult to answer without knowing the specific context or domain these CQs are intended for. However, generally speaking, essential and important CQs often include those that address the key functions or operations of the system, the main entities involved, and their relationships. 

For example, if the domain is healthcare, important CQs might include ""What are the most common diseases in a specific population?"", ""What are the main treatments for a specific disease?"", or ""What factors influence the rate of hospitalization for a specific disease?"". If these types of questions are missing from the manual CQ list, they could be considered essential and important omissions.

2. Without knowing the specific context or domain of the CQs, it's challenging to identify which essential and important CQs are missing from the manual CQ list. However, based on the provided pairs, it seems like the manual CQs are focused on healthcare or hospital-related data, while the generated CQs are more about individual projects. 

   If the context is healthcare, the manual CQs might be missing questions related to patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, or healthcare costs. For example:
   - ""What is the average cost of treatment for a particular disease category?""
   - ""What is the demographic profile of patients with the longest average length of stay?""
   - ""Which treatment has shown the highest effectiveness for a particular disease category?""

   If the context is project management or individual performance, the generated CQs might be missing questions related to project outcomes, timelines, or team performance. For example:
   - ""What was the outcome of Sophia's project?""
   - ""What is the timeline for her current projects?""

The Jaccard similarity measures the intersection divided by the union of two sets, and a score of 0 means there is no overlap between the two sets.

Without the full list of CQs, it's impossible to definitively say which essential and important CQs are missing from the manual CQ list.
